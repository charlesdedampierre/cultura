# Cultural Production Metrics (CPM) Index

This directory contains notebooks for analyzing the Cultural Production Metrics (CPM) index, which quantifies cultural production across different regions and time periods.

## Directory Structure

- **data/** - Directory for storing input datasets and generated index results

## Notebooks

1. **1-plot_region_trends.ipynb**  
   Visualizes regional trends in cultural production over time. This notebook generates plots and charts that illustrate how cultural production has evolved across different geographical regions, highlighting patterns, growth periods, and comparative developments.

2. **2-run_index_great_divergence.ipynb**  
   Calculates and analyzes the CPM index in the context of the "Great Divergence" Debate

## Methodology

The CPM index combines multiple metrics of cultural production to create a composite indicator that allows for comparison across regions and time periods. The index incorporates diversity estimates from the unseen species model to provide a more comprehensive measure of cultural activity.
