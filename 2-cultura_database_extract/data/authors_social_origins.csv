Q77131,Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius,Q77131,1794,Germany,Middle Class,"Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius was born on April 17, 1794, in Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany. His father, Ernst Wilhelm Martius, was an apothecary, a profession that would place the family in the middle class according to the social structure of late 18th-century Germany. The apothecary profession required a level of education and skill, and it provided a stable income, but it did not confer the status or wealth of the elite class. Martius' access to education, which included studying at the University of Erlangen, can be attributed to his family's middle-class status, as education during this period was often inaccessible to the lower classes. There is no evidence to suggest that Martius was born into significant wealth or inherited any privileges or disadvantages due to his birth.","""Martius, Carl Friedrich Philipp von.""
