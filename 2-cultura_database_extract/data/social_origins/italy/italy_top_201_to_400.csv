His father, Amico Carissimi, was a cooper (a barrel maker), which was a skilled trade. This suggests that the family was not of the elite class, but rather part of the middle class, as they were not nobility or wealthy aristocrats, but they were also not subsistence laborers or peasants. The fact that Carissimi was able to receive a good education, becoming a choirboy at the local cathedral and later studying at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, also suggests that his family had some means and was able to support his education.

Giovanni's access to education also suggests a middle-class background. He received his early education from his father, who taught him violin and harpsichord, and later studied with the famous opera composer Giacomo Antonio Perti. This level of education, particularly in music, was not typically available to lower-class families. The family's housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given Antonio's profession, it is likely they lived in a city and had a reasonably comfortable life.","""Giovanni Battista Martini.""

6,Q520573,Giovanni Battista Gaulli,Q520573,1639,Italy,Middle Class,"Giovanni Battista Gaulli, also known as Baciccio, was born in Genoa, Italy around 1639. His family background is not extensively documented, but it is known that he was orphaned at a young age due to a plague that swept through Genoa. This suggests that his family was not of the elite class, as the plague disproportionately affected those living in crowded, less sanitary conditions, which were more typical of the middle and lower classes. Furthermore, Gaulli's early access to education was through the church, as he was taken in by the Jesuits after the death of his parents. This was a common practice for orphans of modest means during this period. While the Jesuits provided a good education, it was not the exclusive, private tutoring often afforded to children of the elite. Therefore, it can be inferred that Gaulli's family was likely of the middle class, with his parents possibly being merchants, artisans, or skilled craftspeople.","""Giovanni Battista Gaulli, 1639-1709"", edited by Franco Mormando (1996); ""The Jesuits and the Arts, 1540-1773"", edited by John W.

Strozzi's mother, Cecilia, was able to provide her children with a good education, which was not a privilege available to all during this period. Strozzi was sent to a Jesuit school, where he received a comprehensive education.

The bourgeoisie typically consisted of merchants, artisans, and skilled craftspeople, and they were often quite prosperous, though not to the extent of the nobility. There is no evidence to suggest that Castiglione's family was impoverished or that they were part of the ruling elite. Furthermore, Castiglione's access to education, as evidenced by his early training in the studio of Giovanni Battista Paggi, suggests that his family had the means to provide him with such opportunities.

Symonds was born in Bristol, not Italy, but he spent much of his childhood traveling throughout Europe due to his father's work and his own health problems. This access to travel and education suggests a high level of family wealth and social standing. 

Symonds' early life housing and living conditions would have been comfortable and privileged. His family owned a large house in Clifton, a fashionable suburb of Bristol, and they employed several servants.

His father, Filippo Fontana, was a stonemason, which would have placed the family within the middle class according to the social structure of 17th-century Italy. Stonemasonry was a skilled craft, and while it did not confer the same level of prestige or wealth as the professions of the elite class, it would have provided the family with a stable income and a certain level of social standing. The fact that Carlo Fontana was able to receive an education in the arts and architecture suggests that his family had the means to provide him with this opportunity, further supporting the classification of the family as middle class. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Fontana family was particularly wealthy or that they lived in luxurious conditions.

His parents were not of the elite or ruling class, but rather of the middle class. His father was a stone mason, a skilled craftsperson, which places the family in the middle class according to the provided typology. Bartolini's family was not wealthy, but they were able to provide him with a basic education, which was not a privilege available to all children at the time. This suggests that the family had some resources, further supporting the classification of middle class. There is no evidence to suggest that Bartolini was born into a family of significant wealth or that he had inherited privileges or disadvantages due to his birth circumstances.","""Lorenzo Bartolini.""

192,Q699662,Giovanni Battista De Rossi,Q699662,1822,Italy,Middle Class,"Giovanni Battista De Rossi was born in Rome on 23 February 1822. His father, Felice De Rossi, was a tailor by profession, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class, as tailoring was a skilled craft. There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they lived a relatively comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. De Rossi's access to education also suggests a middle-class upbringing. He was educated at the Collegio Romano, a prestigious Jesuit school in Rome, which would have been beyond the means of a subsistence-level family. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was part of the elite ruling class or nobility. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his father's profession and his education, it is likely that they were typical of the middle class in Rome at the time.","""Giovanni Battista De Rossi.""

193,Q374572,François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis,Q374572,1715,Italy,Elite,"François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis was born into a noble family in the Kingdom of Savoy, which is now part of modern-day Italy. His father, René de Pierre, was a marquis, and his mother, Marie-Louise de Morozet, was also of noble birth. The family held significant wealth and influence, as was typical for the nobility of the time. This wealth and status would have provided Bernis with access to a high-quality education, likely from private tutors, which was a privilege reserved for the elite. His early life housing and living conditions would have been comfortable, reflecting the family's wealth and status. As a member of the nobility, Bernis would have inherited certain privileges, such as the right to hold certain offices and titles, and would have been exempt from some taxes and obligations that were imposed on the lower classes.","""François-Joachim de Pierre, cardinal de Bernis"" by Jean-Claude Waquet (1982); ""The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of April 2, 1753"" by Salvador Miranda."
194,Q314797,Jacopo della Quercia,Q314797,1374,Italy,Middle Class,"Jacopo della Quercia was born into a family of artists and artisans, which suggests a middle-class background. His father, Piero d'Angelo, was a painter and his mother, Jacopa di Lorenzo, came from a family of stonecutters. This indicates that his family had a certain level of skill and economic stability, typical of the middle class during that period in Italy. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were particularly wealthy or part of the elite ruling class. The fact that Jacopo followed in his family's footsteps and became a sculptor suggests that he had access to some form of education or apprenticeship, again typical of middle-class families at the time. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he lived in particularly luxurious conditions or had any inherited privileges.","Vasari, Giorgio.
