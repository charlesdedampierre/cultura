0,Q1067,Dante Alighieri,Q1067,1265,Italy,Elite,"Dante Alighieri was born into a family that was part of the lower nobility. His family was wealthy and involved in the complex politics of Florence, indicating a high social standing. His father, Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the Battle of Montaperti in the mid 13th century, suggesting he enjoyed certain protections due to his social status. 

Dante's family could afford to provide him with an education, which was a privilege not accessible to all during this period. He was tutored at home and studied Tuscan poetry, which was a sign of a high social standing. His family's wealth and status also allowed him to marry Gemma di Manetto Donati, a member of a powerful Tuscan family.","1. ""Dante Alighieri."" Encyclopædia Britannica.

1,Q1511,Richard Wagner,Q1511,1813,Italy,Middle Class,"Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig, Germany, not Italy, on May 22, 1813. His father, Carl Friedrich Wagner, was a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and his mother, Johanna Rosine Wagner, was the daughter of a baker. After his father's death, his mother remarried to Ludwig Geyer, an actor and playwright. This indicates that Wagner's family was not part of the elite or subsistence classes, but rather the middle class, as they were engaged in skilled professions. Wagner's stepfather, Geyer, likely played a significant role in his early exposure to the arts, particularly theatre and music. Wagner attended the Kreuzschule in Dresden, indicating that his family had the means to provide him with an education, a privilege often associated with the middle class during this period.","""Richard Wagner: A Life in Music"" by Martin Geck (2013), ""Wagner Beyond Good and Evil"" by John Deathridge (2008), ""Richard Wagner: His Life, Art and Thought"" by Ronald Taylor (1979)."
2,Q5592,Michelangelo,Q5592,1475,Italy,Middle Class,"Michelangelo was born on March 6, 1475, in the small village of Caprese, near Arezzo, in Tuscany. His father, Ludovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, was a Florentine official with the title of the Judicial administrator, which was a middle-ranking official role. His family had lost much of its wealth by the time of Michelangelo's birth, but they still maintained an air of nobility due to their lineage tracing back to the counts of Canossa, a fact that Ludovico was very proud of. However, this ancestry did not translate into significant wealth or high social status at the time of Michelangelo's birth. 

Michelangelo's mother, Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena, died when he was six years old, after which he was placed in the care of a stonecutter's wife in the town of Settignano where he learned the basics of stonecutting and carving. This early exposure to the craft could be seen as a form of education, albeit not a formal one. 

In terms of housing and living conditions, Michelangelo likely lived in modest circumstances given his father's limited income. There is no evidence of any significant inherited privileges or disadvantages.","1. ""Michelangelo: A Biography"" by George Bull (1995)

3,Q307,Galileo Galilei,Q307,1564,Italy,Middle Class,"Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy, in 1564 to a family of modest means. His father, Vincenzo Galilei, was a musician and a music theorist. Although the family was not wealthy, they were well-respected and belonged to the middle class. Vincenzo's profession as a musician and music theorist indicates a certain level of education and cultural capital, which is characteristic of the middle class. Galileo's mother, Giulia Ammannati, came from an ancient but not particularly distinguished noble family. 

The family's financial situation was not stable, and they often struggled with debt. However, despite their financial struggles, Galileo was able to receive an education. He initially studied at a monastery near Florence and later enrolled at the University of Pisa to study medicine, although he did not complete his degree. This access to education, even in the face of financial hardship, suggests a middle-class background.","""Galileo: A Life"" by James Reston Jr., ""Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love"" by Dava Sobel, ""Galileo: Watcher of the Skies"" by David Wootton."

The family was not of noble birth or particularly wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. 

Petrarch's access to education was a direct result of his family background. His father, recognizing his son's intellectual potential, sent him to study law in Montpellier and later in Bologna, which were among the best universities in Europe at the time. This level of education was not common among the lower classes and was usually reserved for those of middle or upper-class status.

The family lived in comfortable, if not luxurious, circumstances. After his father's exile from Florence, the family moved to Pisa and then to Avignon, where they lived in a house owned by the family.

Boccaccio was initially trained by his father to follow in his footsteps as a merchant, and later he was sent to study canon law at the Studium (an institution of higher learning) in Naples, which further suggests a middle-class background.

While they were not wealthy, they were not impoverished either, placing them in the middle class according to the social structure of Italy at that time. Verdi's parents recognized his musical talent early on and made sacrifices to provide him with a basic education and music lessons.

His father was a lawyer, albeit not a very prosperous one, which would place the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. The family was not wealthy, but they were not poor either. They owned a house in Florence and a small property in the country. 

Machiavelli's access to education was also a result of his family's middle-class status. His father, despite not being wealthy, valued education and had a small personal library of books on Latin and Italian history, which Niccolò had access to. This indicates that the family had enough resources to invest in education, a luxury not available to the lower classes.

At the age of five, he was sent to the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino, a common practice for sons of nobility.

His father, Giovanni Santi, was a painter and poet at the court of Federico III da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, which suggests a middle-class background. Giovanni Santi was not a nobleman, but his position at the court indicates a certain level of social standing and access to cultural and intellectual resources. Raphael's mother, Magia di Battista Ciarla, came from a merchant family, further supporting the middle-class classification. Raphael's early access to education was likely due to his father's position and connections. Giovanni Santi was known to have taught his son painting techniques and principles, and Raphael may have also had access to the Duke's library, one of the finest in Italy. Raphael's early life housing and living conditions would have been relatively comfortable given his father's court position. However, Raphael was orphaned at age 11, which may have impacted his family's wealth and social standing.","Vasari, Giorgio. ""Life of Raphael."" In Lives of the Artists.

His father, Pietro, was a successful sculptor and architect from Tuscany, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class. The middle class during this period was typically composed of skilled craftspeople, merchants, and professionals, which aligns with Pietro's occupation. There is no evidence to suggest that the Bernini family was part of the aristocracy or the subsistence class. The fact that Bernini was able to receive training in sculpture from his father also indicates that the family had some level of resources and access to education.

There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their time and place. Palladio's early education is not well-documented, but it is known that he was apprenticed to a stonecutter in Padua at the age of 13, which suggests that his family had enough resources to arrange for his vocational training but not enough to provide a more formal education.

33,Q42207,Caravaggio,Q42207,1571,Italy,Middle Class,"Caravaggio, born Michelangelo Merisi, was born in Milan, Italy, in 1571. His father, Fermo Merisi, was an architect and administrator for the Marchese of Caravaggio, a town from which the family took their name. His mother, Lucia Aratori, came from a propertied family of the same district. This suggests that Caravaggio's family was not of the elite nobility, but rather of the middle class, with occupations and property ownership common among this social stratum. The family's connection to the Marchese also suggests a level of social standing above the subsistence class. 

Caravaggio's early access to education is not well-documented, but his apprenticeship with the painter Simone Peterzano, a pupil of Titian, suggests that his family had the resources to secure such training. This is another indication of a middle-class background, as such opportunities were often beyond the reach of the subsistence class. 

Caravaggio's early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but his family's occupations and property ownership suggest a level of comfort above subsistence living.

This suggests that the Ficino family was not of the elite class, as they were in service to them, but they were also not subsistence level, as Diotifeci's profession as a physician required a significant level of education and skill. The family's connection to the Medici family likely provided Marsilio with access to education and resources beyond what would typically be available to the middle class.

Mantegna's father died when he was very young, which likely further strained the family's resources. Mantegna was later adopted by Francesco Squarcione, an artist who recognized his talent. However, this adoption was not due to family connections or wealth, but rather Squarcione's interest in Mantegna's artistic potential.

His father, Michele Carducci, was a doctor, indicating a profession associated with the middle class. His mother, Ildegonda Celli, was from a family of rural bourgeoisie, which further supports the middle-class classification. The family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. Carducci's father's profession likely provided a stable income and a certain level of social standing within their community. 

As for education, Carducci's early access to education was largely due to his father, who was a man of letters and had a vast personal library. His father's influence and the resources available to him would have provided Carducci with a good education from a young age, a privilege often associated with the middle class. 

In terms of housing and living conditions, there is no evidence to suggest that Carducci grew up in either extreme wealth or poverty. His family likely lived in a comfortable home befitting their middle-class status.

Keats' parents were able to afford a good education for him. He attended the Clarke School in Enfield, a well-regarded school where he received a solid grounding in the classics and developed a love for literature. This access to education further supports the classification of Keats as middle class.

Keats' early life housing and living conditions were likely modest but comfortable, given his father's stable employment. After his father's death, his mother remarried quickly, but the marriage was unhappy and she left her new husband, taking her four children to live with her mother.

The family's wealth is not well-documented, but as successful painters, they likely had a comfortable living. Jacopo Bellini was one of the founders of the Renaissance style of painting in Venice and northern Italy, which suggests that he was successful and respected in his profession. 

Giovanni Bellini likely had access to education due to his family background. His father was his first teacher, and he later studied under his brother-in-law, the painter Andrea Mantegna.

This indicates a high social standing and access to political power. The Guicciardini family was also known to be wealthy, owning multiple properties in and around Florence. Francesco's access to education was likely due to his family's wealth and status, as he studied law at the universities of Ferrara and Padua, which were among the leading institutions of higher learning in Europe at the time.

Immanuel Nobel struggled financially during Alfred's early years, and the family lived in poverty. However, in 1837, Immanuel moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he established a mechanical workshop that provided equipment for the Russian army. This venture was successful, and by the time Alfred was nine years old, the family had risen to a comfortable middle-class status. Alfred's mother, Andriette Ahlsell Nobel, came from a wealthy family but her family's wealth did not significantly contribute to Alfred's upbringing due to their initial financial struggles.

Vincenzo Coronelli was able to attend the Convent of the Minor Conventuals and later the College of Saint Francis in Rome, suggesting that his family had the resources to provide him with an education.

The family's wealth at the time of Stefano's birth and childhood is not well-documented, but it is reasonable to assume that they were not impoverished given Anton Domenico's profession. Stefano's access to education was likely due to his family background, as he was apprenticed to a goldsmith and later to a draftsman and engraver, indicating that his family had the resources to provide him with this training.

His father, Bartoluccio Ghiberti, was a trained artist and goldsmith, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class of the social structure. This is because goldsmithing was a skilled craft that required training and skill, and it was a profession that was respected and well-compensated in the late 1300s. Lorenzo's mother's background is not well-documented, but there is no evidence to suggest that she came from a higher or lower social class than her husband. The family likely had a comfortable, but not extravagant, lifestyle. Lorenzo's access to education would have been due to his family background, as his father would have been able to provide him with training in his craft.

This occupation would have provided a comfortable living, but not to the extent of the elite class. There is no evidence to suggest that Longhi's family was particularly wealthy or that they held any significant social standing beyond their trade.

153,Q605447,Antonio Tempesta,Q605447,1555,Italy,Middle Class,"Antonio Tempesta was born in Florence, Italy, around 1555. His father, Giovanni Tempesta, was a successful artisan, specifically a tailor, which places the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. The tailoring profession was a skilled trade, often associated with the middle class in the late 16th century Italy. There is no evidence to suggest that the Tempesta family was part of the nobility or the subsistence class. 

In terms of education, Antonio Tempesta was apprenticed to the Flemish painter and engraver, Joannes Stradanus, at a young age. This suggests that his family had enough resources to secure an apprenticeship, a common practice among middle-class families who could afford to invest in their children's education and future. 

There is no specific information available about the Tempesta family's wealth, housing, or living conditions.
