0,Q121405,Giovanni Paolo Colonna,Q121405,1637,Italy,Middle Class,"Giovanni Paolo Colonna was born in Bologna, Italy, around 1637. His father, Antonio Colonna, was a professional musician and composer, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class. This is because, during the 17th century, musicians were typically considered skilled craftspeople. The Colonna family was not part of the nobility, nor were they peasants or laborers. They had enough resources to provide Giovanni with a good education, as he studied at the music school of San Petronio Basilica in Bologna, which was a privilege typically reserved for the middle class. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or owned significant property. Therefore, it is most likely that they belonged to the middle class.","""Giovanni Paolo Colonna"" by Eleanor Selfridge-Field, in 'The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'; ""Music and Patronage in Seventeenth-Century Italy: Bologna"" by Stephen Bonta."

His uncle's profession as a priest suggests that the family had access to education, which is a characteristic of the middle class.

The Bottrigari family's noble status would have granted Ercole access to education and other privileges not available to those of lower social classes.

His father, Antonio Berti, was a lawyer, which suggests a middle-class background. The profession of law during this period was generally associated with the middle class, as it required a certain level of education and was not typically pursued by the elite or subsistence classes. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Berti family was particularly wealthy or had significant social standing beyond their local community. There is also no record of Berti receiving an education due to his family background, although his father's profession may have provided him with some opportunities in this regard.

4,Q2544209,Domenico Puligo,Q2544209,1492,Italy,Middle Class,"Domenico Puligo was born in Florence, Italy, around 1492. His father, Piero di Jacopo Puligo, was a butcher by trade, which would place the family within the middle class according to the social structure of late 15th-century Italy. This class included skilled craftspeople, such as butchers. There is no evidence to suggest that Puligo's family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. The fact that Puligo was able to receive training as a painter suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education, which was not a given for families of lower social standing. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Puligo was born into the elite class or that he had any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","The primary source for information about Puligo's early life is Giorgio Vasari's ""Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects,"" which provides a brief biography of the artist. However, this source focuses primarily on Puligo's artistic career and does not provide much information about his family background.

6,Q250920,Enrico Betti,Q250920,1823,Italy,Middle Class,"Enrico Betti was born on October 21, 1823, in Pistoia, Tuscany, which was a part of Italy. His father, Giuseppe Betti, was a doctor, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class, as the profession of a doctor was typically associated with this social class during the 19th century. There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they had a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. Betti's access to education also supports this classification. He studied at the University of Pisa, a privilege typically reserved for the middle and upper classes. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this was due to family connections or wealth, rather than merit.

His father, Giovanni Foglietta, was a merchant, which would place them in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. This is further supported by the fact that Foglietta had access to education, which was not common for those in the subsistence class.

There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it can be inferred that they had a stable, middle-class income. Bossi's access to education was likely due to his father's profession, as it was common for children to learn their parents' trades during this period.

His father, Vincenzo Dandini, was a well-established painter, and his uncle, Pietro Dandini, was a successful merchant. This suggests that the Dandini family was part of the elite class in Florence, as they were able to support themselves through their artistic endeavors and trade, which were typically reserved for the upper classes during this period. Furthermore, Cesare's access to education in the arts, which he received from his older brother, Vincenzo Dandini, also indicates that the family had the financial means to provide for such training. This was not a privilege available to those in the middle or subsistence classes. The Dandini family's ability to maintain a household in Florence, a major cultural and economic center in Italy during the late 1500s, further suggests that they were part of the elite class.","""Cesare Dandini.""

The profession of opera singer during the 19th century was often associated with a certain level of social standing and financial stability, although it was not equivalent to the wealth and influence of the elite class. The family's ability to travel between England and Italy also suggests a degree of financial means.

Although the Buonarroti family was of minor nobility, they were not wealthy, and Michelangelo's father struggled to maintain his status. Michelangelo's mother, Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena, came from a middle-class background. 

Michelangelo was the second of five sons in the family. His mother's death when he was six affected the family's living conditions, and he was sent to live with a stonecutter's family, where he was exposed to the art of stone carving. This early exposure to the arts was not due to the family's wealth or status but rather a result of circumstances.

Despite his family's financial struggles, Michelangelo was able to receive an education due to his father's position. He was initially sent to study grammar with the humanist Francesco da Urbino in Florence, but he showed no interest in his schooling, preferring to copy paintings from churches and seek the company of painters.","- Vasari, Giorgio.
