His father, Giovanni Rossi, was a local merchant, which suggests that the family was part of the middle class. The family's wealth was moderate, and they were not considered part of the elite or subsistence classes. Gaetano's access to education was likely due to his family's middle-class status, as education during this period was often limited to the upper and middle classes. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical of a middle-class family in late 18th century Italy, which would have included a comfortable home and access to basic necessities. There is no evidence to suggest that Gaetano inherited any significant privileges or disadvantages due to his family background.","The primary source for this information is the biography of Gaetano Rossi by Luigi Della Corte, published in 1942.

His father, Domenico Labriola, was a school teacher, which suggests a middle-class background. The profession of teaching, especially during the 19th century in Italy, was typically associated with the middle class. It provided a stable income and a certain level of social standing, but did not confer the wealth or status associated with the elite class. This would have given Labriola access to education from an early age, which was a privilege not available to all children at the time, particularly those from subsistence-level families. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Labriola family was particularly wealthy or that Antonio inherited any significant privileges or disadvantages.

This level of education was typically not accessible to the lower classes but was also not exclusive to the elite, as many middle-class families valued education and could afford to send their children to university.

The Alpini family was not part of the nobility or ruling class, nor were they laborers or peasants, indicating they were likely part of the middle class. The fact that Prospero Alpini was able to study medicine at the University of Padua also suggests that his family had the means to support his education, which was not a privilege available to all during this time period.

Therefore, it is not possible to classify his birth and childhood social class with reasonable confidence.","Existing biographical sources on Temistocle Solera, such as ""Temistocle Solera: The Man Who Wrote Verdi"" by Philip Gossett, focus primarily on his career as a librettist and composer. More detailed information about his early life and family background may potentially be found in archival records in Italy, but these have not been digitized or made widely accessible."
193,Q454892,Francesco del Cossa,Q454892,1436,Italy,Middle Class,"Francesco del Cossa was born in Ferrara, Italy, around 1436. His father, Cristoforo del Cossa, was a stonemason, a skilled craftsperson, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class. The fact that Francesco del Cossa was able to become a painter, a profession that required training and materials, suggests that his family had enough resources to support his early education in the arts. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or that they belonged to the ruling class or nobility.","The primary source of information about Francesco del Cossa's early life is Giorgio Vasari's ""Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects,"" which provides some information about his family background and early training. Other sources include various art history books and scholarly articles that discuss del Cossa's work and life."
194,Q331003,Giulio Camillo,Q331003,1480,Italy,,"Giulio Camillo Delminio (also known as Giulio Camillo) was an Italian philosopher, doctor, and scholar, best known for his idea of the ""Theatre of Memory."" However, there is very little information available about his early life, including his family background and social class. His birth date is estimated around 1480, but even that is not certain. His parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing, and inherited privileges or disadvantages are not documented in any known primary sources. Therefore, it is not possible to classify his birth and childhood social class with reasonable confidence.","The primary sources that mention Giulio Camillo, such as his own works and the writings of his contemporaries, do not provide information about his early life. Further research might involve looking for archival documents from the region and time period of his birth, but these may not exist or may not be accessible."
195,Q70423,Wolfgang Helbig,Q70423,1839,Italy,Middle Class,"Wolfgang Helbig was born in Dresden, Germany, in 1839, not Italy. His father, Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Helbig, was a professor of classical philology at the University of Leipzig. This suggests that the family was of the middle class, as they had access to education and a stable income from a professional occupation. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite or subsistence classes. The family's access to education and professional occupation suggests a middle-class standing.","""Wolfgang Helbig"" in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, 1912; ""Wolfgang Helbig"" in Neue Deutsche Biographie, 1959."
196,Q477441,Mino da Fiesole,Q477441,1429,Italy,Middle Class,"Mino da Fiesole, born Mino di Giovanni, was likely born into a middle-class family in the region of Fiesole, Italy. His father, Giovanni di Mino, was a stonemason, which was a skilled trade during the period. This suggests that Mino's family had a moderate level of wealth and social standing, typical of the middle class in 15th-century Italy. The fact that Mino was able to train as a sculptor, a profession that required a significant investment of time and resources, further suggests that his family had the means to support his education. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Mino's family was part of the elite ruling class or that they were subsistence-level laborers or peasants.","Various biographical sources on Mino da Fiesole, including Vasari's ""Lives of the Artists"" and the Oxford Dictionary of Art."
197,Q1136048,Cosimo Bartoli,Q1136048,1503,Italy,Middle Class,"Cosimo Bartoli was born into a family of the Florentine middle class. His father, Pietro Bartoli, was a notary, a profession that was considered part of the middle class during the Renaissance period in Italy. This profession required a certain level of education and was respected, but notaries were not part of the nobility or ruling class. There is no evidence to suggest that the Bartoli family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. Cosimo's access to education would have been due to his family's middle-class status, as education during this period was often limited to the upper and middle classes. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical of the middle class in Florence at the time, likely comfortable but not luxurious. As a member of the middle class, Cosimo would not have been born with any significant inherited privileges or disadvantages.","""Cosimo Bartoli (1503-1572): The Arts of Language and the Language of Arts"" by Angelo Romano, ""The World of the Florentine Renaissance Artist: Projects and Patrons, Workshop and Art Market"" by Martin Wackernagel, ""The Notaries of Florence in the Fourteenth Century"" by Richard C. Trexler."
198,Q555930,Lodovico Grossi da Viadana,Q555930,1560,Italy,Middle Class,"Lodovico Grossi da Viadana was born into a family of modest means in Viadana, a small town in the Duchy of Mantua, Italy. His family name, Grossi, suggests that they were not of noble lineage, as it was common for Italian families of the time to take on surnames that reflected their social status or occupation. The prefix ""da Viadana"" indicates his place of origin, not a noble title. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished. 

His early access to education suggests a middle-class background. He was educated at the Franciscan convent in Viadana, which was typically accessible to families of moderate means. The Franciscan order was known for its commitment to education and service to the community, and it was common for middle-class families to send their children to be educated by the friars. 

His family's ability to provide him with this education suggests that they were not subsistence-level poor, but the lack of any evidence of inherited wealth or privilege suggests that they were not part of the elite. Therefore, it is reasonable to classify Lodovico Grossi da Viadana's birth and childhood social class as middle class.","""Lodovico Grossi da Viadana: A Capuchin Composer's Life and Work"" by Anne Schnoebelen, Journal of Seventeenth-Century Music, 199"
