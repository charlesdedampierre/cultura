His father was a notary, a profession that required literacy and a certain level of education, suggesting that the family was part of the middle class. Notaries were important figures in the local community, often dealing with legal matters and contracts, which further supports the idea that Condivi's family was not subsistence level. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was part of the elite or nobility.

1,Q717097,Francesco Granacci,Q717097,1469,Italy,Middle Class,"Francesco Granacci was born in Florence, Italy, around 1469. His family background is not extensively documented, but it is known that he was apprenticed to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. This suggests that his family had enough resources to arrange and possibly pay for an apprenticeship, a common practice among the middle class during this period. Apprenticeships were often arranged by families who were artisans themselves or had connections in the artisan community. However, there's no evidence to suggest that Granacci's family belonged to the elite class of Florence, such as the Medici family, or that they were subsistence-level laborers or peasants. The fact that Granacci was able to receive training as a painter from a young age also indicates that his family had some means and valued education, another characteristic of the middle class during this period.","Vasari, Giorgio.

There is no evidence to suggest that the Cavallotti family was part of the elite aristocracy or nobility, nor that they were subsistence-level laborers or peasants. The fact that Felice Cavallotti was able to pursue education in law at the University of Pavia also suggests a certain level of family wealth and access to education, which would be consistent with a middle-class upbringing.

The Ferretti family would have had access to the Chigi family's resources, including their library, which would have provided Jacopo with an education beyond what was typical for his social class.

His father was a merchant, which places them in the middle class according to the given typology. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished. His access to education was likely due to his family's conversion to Christianity and their middle-class status, as education in that era was often tied to religious institutions and was more accessible to those of certain social standings. There is no specific information available about his early life housing and living conditions, but as the son of a merchant, it can be inferred that they were likely adequate for the period.

However, considering the social structure and economic context of Florence in the late 14th century, it is reasonable to infer that Starnina was born into a middle-class family. Florence was a thriving center of commerce and art during this period, and the middle class, composed of merchants, artisans, and skilled craftspeople, was particularly prominent. Starnina's later career as a painter suggests that he likely came from an artisanal background, as the skills and training required for this profession were typically passed down through families and apprenticeships, which were accessible primarily to those in the middle class. It is also worth noting that access to education in this period was largely determined by social class, and Starnina's ability to read and write, as evidenced by his signed works, suggests that he likely had some form of education, further supporting the inference that he came from a middle-class background.","The primary sources for this period, including tax records, guild records, and notarial records, do not provide specific information about Starnina's family background.

198,Q503462,Paolo Paruta,Q503462,1540,Italy,Elite,"Paolo Paruta was born into a noble Venetian family. His father, Giovanni Francesco Paruta, was a member of the Venetian nobility, which was the ruling class in Venice during the late 1500s. This would have given Paolo access to education and a comfortable lifestyle from an early age, as the Venetian nobility were known for their wealth and influence. Paolo's early life would have been characterized by the privileges of the elite class, including a high standard of living and access to resources and opportunities not available to the lower classes.","""Paolo Paruta"" by Gaetano Cozzi in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 81 (2014); ""Venice: A Documentary History, 1450-1630"" by David Chambers and Brian Pullan (1992)."
199,Q510472,Andries Both,Q510472,1612,Italy,Middle Class,"Andries Both was born into a family of artisans. His father was a glass painter, which was a skilled craft occupation. This suggests that his family belonged to the middle class. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished. The fact that both Andries and his brother Jan became painters suggests they had access to some form of education or apprenticeship, which was more common among the middle class.","""Dutch Painters of the 17th Century"", The Oxford Dictionary of Art, Oxford University Press.

If you are asking about a different Andries Both born in Italy, I'm afraid I couldn't find any information about such a person. In that case, the classification would be:

Classification: Unknown
Explanation: There is no available information about an individual named Andries Both born in Italy around 1612.
