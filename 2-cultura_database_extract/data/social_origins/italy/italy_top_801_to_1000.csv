His father was a notary, which was a respected profession during that time, indicating that his family was likely part of the middle class.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Piatti family was part of the elite class, as Antonio was a musician, not a noble or a wealthy landowner. Carlo's early access to music education, specifically cello lessons from his uncle, a professional cellist, further supports the classification of the Piatti family as middle class. This access to education, particularly specialized music education, would likely not have been possible if the Piatti family were of the subsistence class. The family's living conditions and wealth at the time of Carlo's birth and childhood are not well-documented, but the fact that Antonio was a working musician suggests that the family had at least a moderate level of income.","""Carlo Alfredo Piatti: A Sketch of His Life and Works"" by F.

Notaries in Italy during this period were typically well-educated and held a respected position in society, often serving as legal advisors and record keepers. This profession would have provided a comfortable living for the family, but not to the extent of the elite class. The fact that Robortello was able to receive an education, attending the University of Padua, suggests that his family had the means to support his studies, a privilege not typically afforded to those of lower social classes.

The family's social standing would have been further elevated by Gaetano's position as a professor at the Brera Academy, one of the leading art schools in Italy. This position would have provided the family with a stable income and a certain level of prestige within the community. Luigi's access to education was also likely influenced by his father's profession.

His family background is not well-documented, but it is known that he was not of noble birth. His father was a notary, a profession that required literacy and some level of education, suggesting a middle-class status. Notaries in Italy during this period were typically part of the bourgeoisie, a class of citizens who were neither nobles nor peasants. They were often involved in commerce or the professions, and had a certain level of wealth and social standing, though not to the extent of the nobility. It is likely that Gastaldi's family had enough resources to provide him with a basic education, as he was able to read and write, skills not common among the lower classes at the time.

As for education, there is no specific information available about Bellucci's early education. However, given his later career as a painter, it is likely that he had some access to education and training in the arts, which would have been more accessible to middle-class families than to those in the subsistence class.

195,Q499658,Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi,Q499658,1719,Italy,Middle Class,"Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi was born in Vicenza, Italy, in 1719. His father, Giovanni Bertotti, was a stonemason, which was a skilled trade and would have placed the family in the middle class according to the typology provided. There is no evidence to suggest that the Bertotti family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. The fact that Ottavio was able to receive an education, as evidenced by his later work as an architect, suggests that his family had the resources to provide him with some level of schooling. However, this education would likely have been vocational in nature, given his father's occupation, rather than the classical education typically provided to the children of the elite. The family's housing and living conditions would likely have been modest but comfortable, in line with their middle-class status. There is no evidence to suggest that Ottavio inherited any significant privileges or disadvantages due to his birth circumstances.","""Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi: The Life, the Works, the Literary Activity"" by Lionello Puppi; ""The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance"" by Peter Murray."
196,Q459906,Alessandro Malaspina,Q459906,1754,Italy,Elite,"Alessandro Malaspina was born into the Malaspina family, an old and noble lineage that had significant influence and wealth in Italy. His father, Carlo Morello Malaspina, was the Marquis of Mulazzo, a title that signifies high social standing and wealth. This noble title would have provided the family with a number of privileges, including access to education and a comfortable living environment. Alessandro's mother, Caterina Meli Lupi di Soragna, also came from a noble family, further solidifying his elite status. 

The Malaspina family was known for their extensive properties and estates, indicating a significant level of wealth at the time of Alessandro's birth and childhood. His family's status would have also granted him access to a high level of education, which was typically reserved for the elite during this time period.","1.

197,Q920115,Girolamo Genga,Q920115,1476,Italy,Middle Class,"Girolamo Genga was born in Urbino, Italy around 1476. His father, Bartolomeo Genga, was a painter and architect, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class, as these professions were typically associated with skilled craftspeople. There is no record of the Genga family being particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it's reasonable to infer that they had a stable income from Bartolomeo's work. As for education, Girolamo likely had access to some form of education due to his father's profession, as it was common for children of artisans to learn their father's trade. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he received a formal education beyond this. The family's living conditions are also unknown, but it's likely that they lived in a home suitable for a middle-class family of the time. There is no record of any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","Various biographies of Girolamo Genga, including ""Girolamo Genga"" by Sydney Joseph Freedberg (1971) and ""The Paintings of Girolamo Genga"" by Paul Barolsky (1986)."
198,Q739419,Giovanni Migliara,Q739419,1785,Italy,Middle Class,"Giovanni Migliara was born in Alessandria, Piedmont, Italy in 1785. His father was a pharmacist, which was a skilled profession during that time period, indicating that the family belonged to the middle class. The family likely had a moderate level of wealth, as pharmacists were typically well-respected and reasonably well-paid members of society. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite or ruling class. The fact that Migliara was able to pursue education in painting and architecture suggests that his family had enough resources to support his studies, which further supports the classification of his family as middle class.","""Giovanni Migliara, a painter in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom"" by Rossana Bossaglia, published in ""Studi Piemontesi"", Vol. VIII, No. 1, March 1979."
199,Q823060,Bernardo Tasso,Q823060,1493,Italy,Elite,"Bernardo Tasso was born into a noble family in Bergamo, Italy. His father, Gaspare Tasso, was a member of the minor nobility and held a position in the court of the Sforza family, a ruling dynasty in Renaissance Italy. This suggests that the Tasso family had a certain level of wealth and prestige at the time of Bernardo's birth. Furthermore, Bernardo's access to education, which included studying law at the University of Padua, indicates that his family had the resources to provide him with a high level of education, a privilege typically reserved for the elite class during this period. The Tasso family's housing and living conditions would have been comfortable and well above the standards of the middle class or subsistence class, given their noble status and court affiliations.","""Bernardo Tasso.""
