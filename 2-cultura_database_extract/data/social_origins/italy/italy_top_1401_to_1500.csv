0,Q3080944,Francesco Alberti di Villanova,Q3080944,1737,Italy,,"Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to definitively classify the birth and childhood social class of Francesco Alberti di Villanova. The late 1700s in Italy was a time of significant social and economic change, and without specific details about Francesco's family background, it is difficult to accurately place him within the social structure of the time. Information about his parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages would be necessary to make a more informed classification.","While there are no specific sources available that provide this information, potential sources that could provide this information include church records, local historical archives, and genealogical databases. Additionally, scholarly research on the social structure of Italy in the late 1700s could provide some context for Francesco's potential social class."

His father, Giuseppe Parlatore, was a pharmacist, which was a skilled profession and would have placed the family in the middle class. There is no evidence to suggest that the Parlatore family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class.

His father, Lazzaro di Matteo, was a physician, a profession that was typically associated with the middle class during this period. This would have provided the family with a stable income and a certain level of social standing within their community. The fact that Civitali later became an apprentice to a sculptor suggests that his family had the means to support his education and training, which further supports the classification of his family as middle class. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or that they owned a significant amount of land, which would have been characteristic of the elite class.

The family's wealth and status would have provided Carolyne with a comfortable early life and access to a high-quality education, which was typical for children of the aristocracy during this period.

Unfortunately, Nuzzi's father died when he was still very young, and his mother remarried a man named Agostino Tassi, a landscape painter. This stepfather likely provided Nuzzi with his initial exposure to art, suggesting that the family had some access to education, albeit informal.

Veronica's birth and childhood were marked by the privileges of the elite class. She lived in a noble household, likely in a large and well-appointed home. Her family's wealth and status would have provided her with access to resources and opportunities not available to those of lower social classes.

One of the most significant of these was education. Veronica was educated by private tutors, a luxury afforded only to the elite. Her education was comprehensive and included Latin, literature, and music, among other subjects. This level of education was not typical for women of the time, even those of the elite class, and speaks to the resources and values of her family.","- Robin, Diana Maury, Anne R.
