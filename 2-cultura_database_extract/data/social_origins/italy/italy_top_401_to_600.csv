The family's ability to move to Florence, a major cultural and economic hub at the time, suggests they had some financial means. Furthermore, Peri was able to receive a musical education, studying under Cristofano Malvezzi. This access to education was likely due to his family's middle-class status, as education in this period was often a privilege of the upper classes.

His father, Matteo Rossi, was a local musician, suggesting that the family was not of the elite class but rather of the middle class, as musicians were typically skilled craftspeople. There is no evidence to suggest that the Rossi family was particularly wealthy or impoverished; they likely had enough to live comfortably but were not among the nobility or ruling class. Luigi Rossi's access to education is also indicative of a middle-class upbringing. He received musical training from a young age, likely from his father, and later studied under the tutelage of Giovanni de Macque in Naples. This suggests that his family had the resources to provide him with a good education, but it was not the kind of elite education that would have been available to the children of the nobility.

There is no evidence to suggest that the Subleyras family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. Pierre Subleyras was able to study at the Royal Academy in Paris, which suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education. However, this does not necessarily indicate that they were wealthy, as the Royal Academy was known to accept students based on talent as well as wealth. The family's housing and living conditions are unknown, but as artisans, they likely lived in a town or city and had a home and workshop. There is no evidence to suggest that Pierre Subleyras inherited any particular privileges or disadvantages due to his family background.","""Pierre Subleyras: A French Artist in Rome"" by Annick Lemoine, ""The Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture: The Birth of the French School, 1648-1793"" by Christian Michel."
192,Q816847,Benedetto Luti,Q816847,1666,Italy,Middle Class,"Benedetto Luti was born in Florence, Italy around 1666. His father, Giovanni Luti, was a silk weaver, which was a skilled craft occupation. This suggests that the Luti family belonged to the middle class, as they were not nobility or peasants, but skilled craftspeople. There is no evidence to suggest that the Luti family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume they were of average means for their class. As for education, Benedetto Luti was apprenticed to a painter at a young age, which was a common practice for middle-class families to provide their children with education and training in a trade. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but as the son of a silk weaver in Florence, it is likely that he lived in a city dwelling and had a relatively comfortable lifestyle compared to lower classes. There is no evidence of any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","""Benedetto Luti: Last of the Florentine Painters"" by Richard E.

193,Q558074,Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli,Q558074,1391,Italy,Middle Class,"Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli, also known as Cyriacus of Ancona, was born in Ancona, Italy, around 1391. His father was a merchant, which places the family in the middle class according to the specified typology. Merchants were a significant part of the middle class in Italy during the late 1300s, as they were involved in trade and commerce, which were thriving in the Italian city-states during this period. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was exceptionally wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. The fact that Ciriaco was able to travel extensively in his later life suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with a good education, which was not common for those in the subsistence class. However, there is not enough information available to determine the specifics of his early life housing and living conditions or any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","""Cyriacus of Ancona: Later Travels,"" edited by Edward W. Bodnar and Clive Foss (2003); ""Cyriacus of Ancona's Journeys in the Propontis and the Northern Aegean, 1444-1445,"" by Edward W. Bodnar and C. Mitchell (1976)."

His father, Jean-Baptiste Nisard, was a school teacher, which positions the family within the middle class according to the provided typology. The profession of teaching, especially during the 19th century, was a respected occupation associated with the middle class. It suggests that the family had a stable income and a certain level of education. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were particularly wealthy or part of the elite. The fact that Désiré Nisard was able to attend school and later the Collège de France also suggests a middle-class background, as education was not universally accessible at the time, particularly to those from lower social classes.","""Désiré Nisard"" by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, published in the Revue des Deux Mondes, 1868; ""Désiré Nisard"" by Ferdinand Brunetière, published in the Revue des Deux Mondes, 1890."
195,Q978614,Girolamo Tiraboschi,Q978614,1731,Italy,Middle Class,"Girolamo Tiraboschi was born in Bergamo, Italy, in 1731. His father, Giovanni Battista Tiraboschi, was a pharmacist, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class during this period. The family likely had some degree of wealth, as they were able to provide Girolamo with a good education. He attended the Jesuit school in Monza, which suggests that his family had the means to afford a quality education. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Tiraboschi family was part of the elite or ruling class. Their lifestyle and occupations suggest a comfortable, but not extravagant, existence.","""Girolamo Tiraboschi"" by Giuseppe Sorgi, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 96 (2019); ""Storia della letteratura italiana"" by Girolamo Tiraboschi (1772-1782)."
196,Q1867806,Lodovico Dolce,Q1867806,1508,Italy,Middle Class,"Lodovico Dolce was born in Venice around 1508. His father was a physician, which was a respected profession during the Renaissance period in Italy. This suggests that his family was likely part of the middle class, as physicians were typically well-educated and had a stable income, but they were not part of the nobility. There is no evidence to suggest that Dolce's family was particularly wealthy or that they were part of the ruling class. Furthermore, Dolce's access to education, which allowed him to become a writer and translator, was likely due to his family's middle-class status. In the 16th century, education was not universally accessible and was often limited to the middle and upper classes. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Dolce's family was wealthy enough to afford a private tutor, which was common among the elite class. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Dolce was born into a middle-class family.","""Lodovico Dolce: Renaissance Man of Letters"" by Ronnie H. Terpening."
197,Q1055239,Camillo Boito,Q1055239,1836,Italy,Middle Class,"Camillo Boito was born in Venice, Italy, in 1836. His father, Giovanni, was a painter and teacher at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice, which suggests a middle-class background. His mother, Lucia, was also from a middle-class family. The family was not wealthy, but they were not poor either. They had enough resources to provide their children with a good education. Camillo and his brother, Arrigo, both attended the Liceo Musicale in Milan, which was a prestigious institution at the time. This suggests that the family had some means and valued education, which is characteristic of the middle class. The family lived in a comfortable home in Venice, and there is no evidence of any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","""Camillo Boito: A Venetian Architect and Writer"" by Margherita Azzi Visentini; ""Camillo Boito: Un protagonista del dibattito architettonico del secondo Ottocento"" by Sergio Polano."
198,Q1232500,Gasparo Gozzi,Q1232500,1713,Italy,Middle Class,"Gasparo Gozzi was born into a middle-class family in Venice, Italy. His father, Giovan Antonio Gozzi, was a minor Venetian official and his mother, Angela Tiepolo, came from a family of painters. This suggests that the family had a certain level of social standing and economic stability, characteristic of the middle class. The Gozzi family was not part of the Venetian nobility, but they were also not subsistence laborers or peasants. Gasparo Gozzi had access to education, as evidenced by his later career as a writer and journalist, which would have been unlikely without some form of early education. However, this education was likely due to his family's middle-class status, not because of any inherited privileges or wealth. The family's living conditions would have been comfortable but not luxurious, typical of the middle class in Venice at the time.","""Gasparo Gozzi: His Life and Works"" by J. R. Woodhouse; ""The Venetian Middle Class in the Renaissance"" by Patricia Fortini Brown."
199,Q3766656,Giovanni Battista Falda,Q3766656,1643,Italy,Middle Class,"Giovanni Battista Falda was born in Valduggia, a small town in the Piedmont region of Italy. His father was a stonemason, which suggests that the family belonged to the skilled craftspeople category of the middle class. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their time and place. Falda's access to education is unclear, but his later work as an engraver and architect suggests that he may have had some formal training in these areas, which would have been more likely if his family had the means to provide it. His early life housing and living conditions are also unknown, but given his father's occupation, it is likely that they were adequate. There is no evidence to suggest that Falda inherited any particular privileges or disadvantages due to his family background.","""Giovanni Battista Falda,"" Oxford Art Online.
