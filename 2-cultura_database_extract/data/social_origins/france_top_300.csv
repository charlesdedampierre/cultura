0,Q535,Victor Hugo,Q535,1802,France,Middle Class,"Victor Hugo was born on February 26, 1802, in Besançon, France. His father, Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo, was a high-ranking officer in Napoleon's army, which would place the family in the middle class. His mother, Sophie Trébuchet, came from a family of ship owners from Nantes, which also suggests a middle-class background. The family was not of noble lineage or extreme wealth, but they were not impoverished either. 

Victor Hugo's access to education was likely due to his family's middle-class status. His mother was known to be well-educated and is believed to have taught Victor and his siblings at home. Furthermore, Hugo's father's military career would have provided a level of financial stability and social standing that allowed for educational opportunities.

The family moved frequently due to Joseph Hugo's military assignments, suggesting that their housing and living conditions varied. However, there is no indication that they lived in extreme poverty or had access to the luxuries of the elite class.

In terms of inherited privileges or disadvantages, Hugo was born into a politically turbulent time in France, with his father supporting Napoleon and his mother a Royalist. This political divide in his family may have presented both opportunities and challenges, but it does not significantly alter his classification as middle class.","- ""Victor Hugo: A Biography"" by Graham Robb

His father, Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns, was a government clerk in the French Ministry of the Interior but died of tuberculosis three months after Camille's birth. This left his mother, Clémence Saint-Saëns, a widow. She moved in with her unmarried aunt, Charlotte Masson, who had been a first-rate pupil of the pianist Ignaz Moscheles. This suggests that the family had some means, as piano lessons were often a sign of middle-class status. 

Camille's early education was overseen by his mother and aunt. His aunt introduced him to the piano, and he showed prodigious talent from an early age. This early access to education and music training suggests a middle-class upbringing, as lower-class families would not have had the resources for such pursuits. 

The family's living conditions are not well-documented, but the fact that they could afford to live in Paris, one of the most expensive cities in France, suggests a certain level of wealth. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite or aristocracy. 

In terms of inherited privileges or disadvantages, it seems that Camille's main advantage was his family's ability to provide him with a good education and early exposure to music. His main disadvantage was the early death of",No sources provided

Thiers' father passed away when he was a young child, and his mother struggled to support the family, but they were not destitute. Thiers was able to attend a local school due to his mother's efforts and the support of his maternal grandfather.

His father, Bartolomeo Cherubini, was a musician and worked at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence. This suggests that the family was not of the elite class, as Bartolomeo's profession was not one typically associated with the nobility. However, they were also not subsistence class, as Bartolomeo's profession required a certain level of skill and education. Luigi Cherubini himself was able to receive a good education in music from a young age, indicating that the family had enough resources to provide for this. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his father's profession, it is likely that they were at least comfortable.

His father, Nicolas Le Brun, was a sculptor who served as a deputy to the rector of the community of artists in Paris, which suggests a middle-class standing. Charles Le Brun's early access to education was likely due to his family background. His father was able to provide him with initial training in art, and he was later apprenticed to Simon Vouet, a prominent French painter, which was a common practice for middle-class families to provide their children with education and skills.

94,Q468618,Dominique Vivant,Q468618,1747,France,Middle Class,"Dominique Vivant, who later became known as Baron Denon, was born in Givry, France, in 1747. His father, Étienne Vivant, was a chevalier (knight) and civil servant, serving as the king's counselor and master of requests. This indicates a level of professional status and income, but not the wealth or inherited nobility associated with the elite class. The title of chevalier was often granted to civil servants and did not necessarily indicate nobility. His mother, Marie-Élisabeth Bruel, was from a family of lawyers. The family's ability to provide Dominique with a good education, including studying law in Paris, suggests they had some financial resources, but again, this is more indicative of a middle-class background than an elite one.

This class included skilled craftspeople like Watteau's father. There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they lived a typical middle-class lifestyle for the time. Watteau's access to education was likely limited, as was common for children of his class during this period. However, he did receive some training in painting from a local artist, which suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with this opportunity. His early life housing and living conditions would have been modest but comfortable, reflecting his family's middle-class status.

Despite their limited means, Proudhon's parents valued education and made sacrifices to ensure their children could attend school. However, Proudhon's formal education was cut short when his father's business failed, and he was forced to work as a cowherd and later as a printer's apprentice to help support his family.

His father, Andreu Rigau, was a tailor and his mother, Maria Serra, was a daughter of a shoemaker. This suggests that Rigaud's family was part of the middle class, as both tailoring and shoemaking were skilled crafts at the time.

This access to education, while not necessarily indicative of great wealth, suggests that his family had enough resources to invest in his schooling.

Fourier and his two siblings were then left in the care of their father's former employer, who was also a tailor. This suggests that Fourier's family was not wealthy and likely lived at a subsistence level. The fact that Fourier was able to attend the local military school, École Royale Militaire of Auxerre, was not due to his family's wealth or social standing, but rather because the school was run by Benedictine monks who provided education for orphans.

Despite the loss of the family's patriarch, Augusta was able to maintain the family's middle-class status through the management of the properties left by her husband. 

Bartholdi's middle-class upbringing is further evidenced by his access to education. He attended the Lycee Louis-le-Grand in Paris, a school typically attended by the children of the middle and upper classes. His family's financial stability and social standing would have facilitated his enrollment in this institution.
