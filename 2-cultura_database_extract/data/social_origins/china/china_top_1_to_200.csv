198,Q890613,Dong Yuan,Q890613,934,China,Middle Class,"Dong Yuan was born in Zhongling (now Jinxian, Jiangxi). His family was of moderate social standing, and he had access to education due to his family background. His father was a Confucian scholar, which suggests that his family was not of the subsistence class but also not of the elite class. The family's social standing allowed Dong Yuan to study painting under masters of his time, indicating that they had enough resources to support his education. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was part of the ruling class or nobility. Therefore, it is reasonable to classify his birth and childhood social class as middle class.","""Dong Yuan."" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dong-Yuan"
199,Q697571,Wu Weiye,Q697571,1609,China,Middle Class,"Wu Weiye was born into a family of scholars in Jiangsu province, China, around 1609. His father, Wu Xingzuo, was a jinshi degree holder, the highest level in the imperial examination system, and served as a government official. This indicates that the family had a certain level of wealth and social standing, as well as access to education, which was a privilege not available to everyone in society at the time. However, they were not part of the ruling class or nobility, which suggests that they were part of the middle class. Wu Weiye's early life housing and living conditions would have been comfortable but not luxurious, reflecting his family's middle-class status. There is no evidence to suggest that he inherited any significant privileges or disadvantages due to his family background.","""Wu Weiye,"" Encyclopedia of China (3rd Edition), 2018; ""The Imperial Examination System in Ming-Qing China,"" by Benjamin A.
