196,Q16076318,Xu Dong,Q16076318,976,China,,"The specific details about Xu Dong's birth circumstances and family background are not readily available in historical records or scholarly references. The late 900s in China, during the Song Dynasty, was a period of significant social mobility, so it's possible that Xu Dong could have come from any of the three social classes. However, without specific information about Xu Dong's parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing, and inherited privileges or disadvantages, it's not possible to determine his social class with reasonable confidence.","Potential sources that could provide this information include Song Dynasty administrative records, genealogical records, and local histories. However, these sources are often incomplete or not readily accessible. Further research in Chinese archives or consultation with specialists in Song Dynasty social history may be necessary to obtain more information about Xu Dong's family background."
197,Q16076458,Lin Gudu,Q16076458,1580,China,,"Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to definitively classify the social class of Lin Gudu at the time of his birth and childhood. Lin Gudu is not a well-known historical figure, and there are no readily available primary sources that detail his early life, family background, or social circumstances. It is therefore not possible to accurately determine his parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, living conditions, or inherited privileges or disadvantages.","N/A

Further research may be necessary to uncover more information about Lin Gudu's early life. This could involve consulting historical records, genealogical databases, or scholarly works on the social and economic conditions of China in the late 1500s. However, given the lack of information currently available, it is unlikely that a definitive classification can be made."
198,Q16078822,Gu Gao,Q16078822,1763,China,,"There is insufficient information available about Gu Gao's birth circumstances and family background. The name Gu Gao is not widely recognized in historical records from the late 1700s in China, and there are no clear references to his parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, or inherited privileges or disadvantages. It is therefore not possible to classify his social class at birth and during childhood with reasonable confidence.","A comprehensive search of available historical databases, scholarly articles, and ancient texts did not yield specific information about Gu Gao's family origins. Further research may be required, potentially involving archival research in China or consultation with specialists in the history of the period."
199,Q4499522,Guo Chun,Q4499522,1370,China,,"There is limited historical information available about the early life and family background of Guo Chun, born around 1370 in China. His parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages are not well-documented in historical sources. Therefore, it is not possible to classify his birth and childhood social class with reasonable confidence.","While there are several historical texts and scholarly references that discuss Guo Chun's later life and accomplishments, they do not provide detailed information about his birth circumstances and family background. Further research may be needed in Chinese historical archives or through consultation with experts in the field."
