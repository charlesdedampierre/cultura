189,Q1448101,Franz Ludwig Stadlin,Q1448101,1658,China,,"There is limited information available about the early life and family background of Franz Ludwig Stadlin, especially considering he was born in the late 17th century in China. As a Swiss Jesuit missionary, most records about him focus on his later life and work. The lack of specific details about his parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages makes it difficult to classify his birth and childhood social class with reasonable confidence.","The potential sources that could provide this information might include church records, missionary reports, or other historical documents from the period. However, these sources are not readily available or might not have survived. Further research in Swiss or Chinese archives might yield more information."
190,Q11136789,Wang Maolin,Q11136789,1640,China,,"Wang Maolin is a relatively common name in Chinese history, and without more specific details, it's difficult to determine the exact individual you're referring to who was born around 1640. The late 1600s was a period of significant social and political change in China, with the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty, and the social class of individuals could vary greatly depending on their family's alignment with these political changes. Without more specific information about Wang Maolin's family background, it's not possible to definitively classify his birth and childhood social class.","Potential sources that could provide this information include local historical records from the period, such as the ""Local Gazetteers"" (地方志), which often recorded notable families and individuals, or family genealogies, if available. Additionally, historical studies of the period, such as ""The Cambridge History of China: Volume 9, The Ch'ing Dynasty to 1800"" may provide broader context for understanding social class during this period."
191,Q11093738,Zhu Shan,Q11093738,1340,China,,"The information about Zhu Shan's birth circumstances and family background is not readily available. The late 1300s in China was a period of the Yuan dynasty transitioning into the Ming dynasty, and many records from this time are incomplete or lost. Without specific details about Zhu Shan's parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing, and inherited privileges or disadvantages, it is not possible to classify their birth and childhood social class with reasonable confidence.","The primary sources that could potentially provide this information include local gazetteers, household registries, and other administrative records from the Yuan or early Ming dynasties. However, these sources are often incomplete, not easily accessible, and require specialized knowledge to interpret. Secondary sources might include scholarly works on social history of late Yuan and early Ming China, but these are also limited and may not contain specific information about individuals like Zhu Shan."
192,Q24203363,Edouard-Ernest Maire,Q24203363,1848,China,,"There is insufficient information available to definitively classify the birth and childhood social class of Edouard-Ernest Maire. The name suggests French origins, but the birthplace in China complicates the matter. The social structure and economic context of China in the late 1800s was complex, with a mix of local and foreign influences. Without specific information about Maire's parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages, it is not possible to accurately classify his social class at birth and during childhood.","No specific sources could be identified that provide this information. Potential sources that could provide this information include birth records, census data, family histories, and local histories from the time and place of Maire's birth."

Her father, Xie An, was a high-ranking official who served as the Prime Minister of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Her mother, Lady Wang, also came from a noble family. The Xie family was one of the most influential families in the Jin Dynasty, with a lineage of scholars and officials. This suggests that Xie Daoyun was born into the elite class. Her family's wealth and status would have provided her with access to education and a comfortable living environment, which were privileges not accessible to those of lower social classes at the time.","""The Book of Jin"" (Jin Shu), a historical text that covers the history of the Jin Dynasty, provides detailed accounts of the Xie family.

The name Zhang Feng is quite common in Chinese history, and without additional details such as his place of birth or his parents' names, it is challenging to identify the correct individual and provide accurate information about his social origins. Furthermore, records from the late 1600s in China, especially those concerning individuals who were not part of the ruling class or nobility, are often sparse or non-existent.","Potential sources that could provide this information include local historical records, genealogical records, or scholarly research on the social history of China during this period.

Her father, Ban Biao, was a historian and the family was known for their literary work. This suggests that they were part of the elite class, as literacy and scholarly pursuits were often associated with the upper classes in ancient China. Furthermore, the Ban family was known to have connections with the imperial court, which further suggests their elite status. However, it's important to note that the specific details about Ban Jieyu's early life and family circumstances are not well-documented, so this classification is based on the general status and reputation of the Ban family during this period.","""Book of Han,"" ""Book of the Later Han,"" and various scholarly articles on the Ban family and the social structure of the Western Han Dynasty."
