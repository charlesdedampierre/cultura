189,Q1448101,Franz Ludwig Stadlin,Q1448101,1658,China,,"There is limited information available about the early life and family background of Franz Ludwig Stadlin, especially considering he was born in the late 17th century in China. As a Swiss Jesuit missionary, most records about him focus on his later life and work. The lack of specific details about his parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages makes it difficult to classify his birth and childhood social class with reasonable confidence.","The potential sources that could provide this information might include church records, missionary reports, or other historical documents from the period.

190,Q11136789,Wang Maolin,Q11136789,1640,China,,"Wang Maolin is a relatively common name in Chinese history, and without more specific details, it's difficult to determine the exact individual you're referring to who was born around 1640. The late 1600s was a period of significant social and political change in China, with the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty, and the social class of individuals could vary greatly depending on their family's alignment with these political changes. Without more specific information about Wang Maolin's family background, it's not possible to definitively classify his birth and childhood social class.","Potential sources that could provide this information include local historical records from the period, such as the ""Local Gazetteers"" (Âú∞ÊñπÂøó), which often recorded notable families and individuals, or family genealogies, if available.

The name suggests French origins, but the birthplace in China complicates the matter. The social structure and economic context of China in the late 1800s was complex, with a mix of local and foreign influences. Without specific information about Maire's parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages, it is not possible to accurately classify his social class at birth and during childhood.","No specific sources could be identified that provide this information.

This suggests that they were part of the elite class, as literacy and scholarly pursuits were often associated with the upper classes in ancient China. Furthermore, the Ban family was known to have connections with the imperial court, which further suggests their elite status.
