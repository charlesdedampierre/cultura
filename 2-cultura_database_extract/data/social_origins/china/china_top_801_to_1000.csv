The primary sources that mention Śubhakarasiṃha, such as the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, focus primarily on his religious activities and translations in China, not his birth circumstances or family background in India.

His father was a scholar, which was a respected occupation in the Ming Dynasty, indicating a middle-class background. The family's wealth is not well-documented, but the fact that Xie Shichen was able to study painting from a young age suggests they had some resources. In the Ming Dynasty, education was not universally accessible and was often limited to those with means. The family's housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given the father's occupation, they likely lived in a scholar's residence, which would have been modest but comfortable.

188,Q11068290,Zhang Hong,Q11068290,1577,China,Middle Class,"Zhang Hong was born in a family of scholars, which places him in the middle class according to the social structure of late Ming Dynasty China. His father, Zhang Jucheng, was a juren, a successful candidate in the imperial examination at the provincial level. This indicates that his family had a certain level of wealth and social standing, as well as access to education, which was necessary for Zhang Jucheng to pass the imperial examination. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Zhang Hong's family was part of the elite ruling class or nobility. The family's scholarly background and Zhang Jucheng's status as a juren suggest that they lived in decent conditions, but not in the luxury associated with the elite class.
