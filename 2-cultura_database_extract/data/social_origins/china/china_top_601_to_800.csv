His birth and childhood circumstances in China are not well-documented, making it difficult to classify his social class according to the given typology. His family background, parents' occupations, and social standing in China are not known. Similarly, there is no available information about his family's wealth at the time of his birth and childhood, his access to education due to family background, early life housing and living conditions, or inherited privileges or disadvantages.","There are no known primary sources that provide this information. Potential sources that could provide this information include church records, personal letters, or other documents from the Jesuit mission in China during the late 1700s. However, these documents, if they exist, are not readily available or have not been translated and studied. Further research in French and Chinese archives may yield more information."

His father, Chen Zilong, was a well-known poet and official, indicating that the family had a certain level of social standing and wealth. The family's scholarly tradition suggests that Chen Zhengkui would have had access to education from an early age, a privilege not common among the lower classes. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite ruling class or nobility.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite ruling class or nobility. The family's wealth likely came from Xu Xun's work as a teacher and scholar, placing them in the middle class. Xu Shou's access to education was likely due to his family background, as his father would have been able to provide him with a good education.
