His father was Matsudaira Sadakuni, a daimyo (feudal lord) of the Shirakawa Domain. This places Sadanobu in the elite class, as the samurai were the ruling military class of the time, and daimyo were among the most powerful figures within that class. The Matsudaira clan was particularly influential, being directly related to the Tokugawa shogunate, the ruling military government. Sadanobu's birth into this family would have granted him access to education and a high standard of living, as was customary for children of the samurai class.

His father's position as a samurai would have provided Sōgi with some access to education, as samurai families were typically literate and valued learning.

Some were wealthy landowners, while others were more akin to middle-class bureaucrats or even lower-class soldiers.

Bunchō's family would have had some level of wealth and social standing due to their samurai status, but not to the extent of the elite class. As a samurai's son, Bunchō would have had access to education, which was highly valued in samurai families. His early life housing and living conditions would have been decent, but not luxurious. 

There is no evidence of any inherited privileges or disadvantages, beyond the general advantages and disadvantages associated with being a samurai's son in this period. For example, he would have been expected to follow in his father's footsteps and serve as a samurai, which could be seen as both a privilege and a disadvantage depending on one's perspective.","- ""Ippitsusai Bunchō: A"

He was originally a samurai from the Tosa domain, but he moved to Edo and became a townsman. Samurai were a social class in Japan that were considered part of the ruling class, but not all samurai were wealthy or influential. Many, like Koryūsai, were lower-ranking samurai who lived modestly. His transition from samurai to townsman suggests that he was not from a high-ranking samurai family, as those from powerful samurai families would have been unlikely to abandon their status. As a townsman, Koryūsai would have been part of the chōnin class, which was a middle class of sorts in Edo period Japan.

Bakin's mother, Omon, was a merchant's daughter, which also places her in the middle class. Bakin had access to education because of his family background.

Despite this, Bairei's family still had access to education, as samurai families traditionally valued learning. Bairei was able to study painting from a young age under the tutelage of Nakajima Raisho, a painter of the Maruyama school. This suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education in the arts, a luxury not available to those in the subsistence class.

His family was of the samurai class, but by the time of his birth, they had fallen into the merchant class. His father was a merchant, which indicates that they were not of the elite class but rather the middle class. The samurai class, while traditionally warriors, had become more bureaucratic and administrative by the Edo period, and many samurai families, like Sosen's, had fallen into other professions. Sosen's family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. They had enough resources to provide Sosen with an education, as he was known to have studied painting from a young age. This suggests that his family had enough wealth to afford a tutor or school fees, which was not a privilege available to the lower classes.

The artists in the Utagawa school were primarily from middle-class backgrounds, as the profession of a ukiyo-e artist was considered a craft, not a high art.

The samurai class, while not as wealthy as the daimyo (feudal lords), were still considered a privileged class in Japan, with a status above commoners. They were the military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan. However, by the late Edo period, many samurai families, while maintaining their social status, were not particularly wealthy, and some were in fact quite poor. Samurai were given a stipend, but it was often not enough to cover all their expenses, especially as the cost of living increased in the late Edo period. Therefore, while Icchō's family had a high social status, they were not necessarily wealthy. As a samurai family, they would have had access to education, and Icchō himself was known to have studied painting from a young age.

His father was a low-ranking samurai who served the shogunate, and his mother came from a family of merchants. This suggests that Teisai's family was not part of the elite, but they were also not subsistence-level laborers or peasants.

Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties, kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers, scenes from history and folk tales, travel scenes and landscapes, flora and fauna, and erotica.

1084,Q7094448,Onoe Kikugorō V,Q7094448,1844,Japan,Middle Class,"Onoe Kikugorō V was born into a family of kabuki actors, a profession that was considered respectable and skilled, but not aristocratic or elite. His father, Onoe Kikugorō III, was a well-known kabuki actor, and his mother was also from a kabuki family. This suggests that he was born into the middle class according to the provided typology. Kabuki actors were not wealthy landowners or nobility, but they were skilled craftspeople and artists, which aligns with the middle class category. There's no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, but they likely had a stable income from their work in the theater. As the son of a kabuki actor, Kikugorō V would have had access to education in the form of training in the kabuki tradition. His early life housing and living conditions were likely modest but comfortable, typical of a middle-class family in late 19th-century Japan.

His father was a samurai, which was a class of military nobility in Japan. However, during the Edo period, the samurai class was experiencing financial difficulties due to the policy of sankin-kōtai, which required them to maintain residences in both their home provinces and in Edo. This led many samurai families to live a middle-class lifestyle despite their noble status. Nakazo's family was likely in this situation, as his father worked as a rōnin, or masterless samurai, which was a lower status within the samurai class. Nakazo would have had access to education as a child, as it was common for samurai families to educate their children, but his family's financial situation would have been modest.
