His parents were Joseph Tylor and Harriet Skipper, part of the Quaker community. His father, Joseph Tylor, was a brass founder and a successful businessman, which indicates a middle-class background.

The fact that Thomas Bayes was able to pursue an education, attending the University of Edinburgh to study logic and theology, indicates that his family had the financial means to support his studies.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was part of the elite or aristocracy, nor that they were subsistence-level laborers or peasants. The occupation of musician, while respected, was typically associated with the middle class during this period.

The family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. They were able to afford a modest house in Broad Street, in the district of Golden Square of Soho, a respectable if not fashionable part of London. 

Blake was the third of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. The Blakes were English Dissenters, a Christian movement that developed in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and were known for their independence of thought. This religious background may have influenced the family's decision to educate William at home, rather than sending him to a conventional school. Blake's mother taught him to read and write, and his father encouraged his artistic talents by buying him casts to draw and sending him to drawing school. 

While Blake did not have access to a formal education, his family's resources and support allowed him to develop his artistic and literary skills from a young age.

16,Q179126,John Ruskin,Q179126,1819,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"John Ruskin was born on February 8, 1819, to Margaret Cox and John James Ruskin. His father, John James Ruskin, was a sherry and wine importer, a profession that would place the family in the middle class. The family was not of aristocratic lineage, nor were they struggling for subsistence. They were comfortably well-off, but not excessively wealthy. 

Ruskin's early education was provided at home by his mother, a practice common among the middle class of the time. This education was comprehensive, including the Bible, literature, and the works of great painters, which would later influence his career. 

The family lived in a variety of homes throughout Ruskin's childhood, including a house at Herne Hill, in the south of London, which was a comfortable middle-class suburb.

Engels had access to education due to his family's status. He attended grammar school in Elberfeld but his parents' wealth and social standing allowed him to receive private tutoring in languages and literature at home. 

The family lived in a comfortable home in Barmen and later, when his father sent him to work in Manchester, Engels lived in a middle-class neighborhood.

Her father, Robert Evans, was a manager for the Arbury Hall Estate, a position that provided the family with a comfortable income and a relatively high social standing within their community. This would place them firmly within the middle class according to the typology provided. Mary Ann was the youngest of three children, and her early life was spent in a substantial farmhouse, indicative of their middle-class status. 

In terms of education, Mary Ann was sent to boarding school at the age of five, which was a privilege not typically afforded to those of lower social classes. Her family's financial stability and social standing allowed her to receive a good education, further cementing their middle-class status. 

However, it's important to note that her family was not part of the elite or aristocracy. They did not hold titles, nor did they have significant wealth beyond their comfortable living. They were not landowners but lived on an estate owned by a local aristocrat. 

Inherited privileges included a good education and a comfortable upbringing, but there were no titles or significant wealth passed down to her. Her father's position did afford her some opportunities, such as access to the estate's library, but these were not inherited privileges in the traditional sense.","- ""George Eliot: A Life"" by Rosemary Ashton"

Richard Hogarth was an unsuccessful businessman who spent time in debtor's prison, which would have significantly affected the family's living conditions and wealth during William's childhood. Despite these hardships, William was able to access education, likely due to his father's profession. He was apprenticed to a silver plate engraver, a skilled trade, in his early teens. This suggests that the family, despite their financial struggles, still had the resources and connections to secure such an apprenticeship.

As the son of a vicar, Hobbes would have been considered middle class. His father's occupation provided a stable, if modest, income and a certain level of social respectability. 

Hobbes' access to education was a direct result of his family background. His uncle, a tradesman with no children of his own, provided for Hobbes' education. He was able to attend a grammar school in Westport and later went on to study at Magdalen Hall, which is now Hertford College, Oxford. This level of education was not common for the lower classes, further suggesting that Hobbes was born into a middle-class family.

Hobbes' early life housing and living conditions would have been modest but comfortable. As the vicar's family, they would have lived in the vicarage, a house provided by the church. This would have been a step above the living conditions of the lower classes, but not as luxurious as the homes of the wealthy.","- ""Thomas Hobbes.""

45,Q44490,John Henry Newman,Q44490,1801,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"John Henry Newman was born on February 21, 1801, in London, England. His father, John Newman, was a banker in the City of London. His mother, Jemima Fourdrinier, came from a family of Huguenot paper makers who owned a paper mill in Hampshire. This suggests that the family was of the middle class, as they were involved in skilled professions and business, but were not part of the aristocracy or ruling class. Newman's family was able to afford a private tutor for him and his siblings, indicating a certain level of wealth and access to education. However, the family's fortunes declined due to the financial crisis of 1816 and the bank's subsequent failure, causing Newman to withdraw from school and be tutored at home. This suggests that while the family had some wealth, it was not substantial or secure enough to weather economic downturns.","""John Henry Newman: A Biography"" by Ian Ker, Oxford University Press, 2009; ""The Life of John Henry, Cardinal Newman: Based on His Private Journals and Correspondence"" by Wilfrid Ward, Longmans, Green, and Co., 1912."

His mother, Elizabeth Heywood, was the daughter of a playwright and a relative of Sir Thomas More, indicating some level of social standing, but not necessarily wealth. 

Donne's father died when he was very young, leaving the family in a precarious financial situation. However, Donne was still able to receive a good education, attending both Hart Hall, Oxford, and the University of Cambridge, although he did not take a degree at either institution due to his Catholic faith.

This suggests that the family had a certain level of financial stability and social standing. Whistler was able to attend the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg due to his family's status, indicating access to education.

The Stoker family was not wealthy, but they were not living in poverty either. They were able to provide for their seven children, of which Bram was the third. The family lived in a semi-detached house, a typical dwelling for middle-class families in the Victorian era.

Bram Stoker's access to education was also indicative of his middle-class background. He attended a private day school, the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin, from the age of seven.

His father, John Gainsborough, was a weaver and a maker of woolen goods, which was a skilled trade and would have placed the family in the middle class. The family was not wealthy, but they were not poor either. They owned their own home and had enough income to support a large family. Thomas was the youngest of nine children.

This mixed religious background would have placed the family in a somewhat precarious social position in Ireland at the time, but their professional and gentry status would have provided a degree of stability and comfort. Burke's father's profession as a lawyer indicates a middle-class background, as does the family's ability to send Burke to a Quaker boarding school in Ballitore, County Kildare, and later to Trinity College, Dublin.

Babbage's early education was largely private, a common practice among the middle class of the time. He was tutored at home by a private tutor and later attended two private schools in London. This suggests that his family had enough wealth to afford private education, a privilege not accessible to the lower classes.

This is further supported by the fact that Macpherson was able to attend King's College, Aberdeen, and later Marischal College, indicating that his family had enough wealth to afford his education. However, it's important to note that his access to education was also partly due to the patronage of Clan Chief, Cluny Macpherson, which suggests that his family had some social standing within their local community. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his father's occupation and his access to education, it's reasonable to infer that they were typical of the middle class during this period.","""James Macpherson.""

133,Q160270,David Ricardo,Q160270,1772,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"David Ricardo was born in London, England, in 1772 to a family of Sephardic Jews who had recently emigrated from the Netherlands. His father, Abraham Ricardo, was a successful stockbroker and a member of the London Stock Exchange, which suggests a middle-class background. The family was well-off, but not part of the aristocracy or ruling class. David Ricardo was the third of seventeen children, which indicates that the family had enough resources to support a large family. Regarding education, Ricardo received a good one, but it was cut short when he joined his father's business at the age of 14. This suggests that while the family had access to education, it was not to the extent that the elite class would have had. The family's housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given Abraham Ricardo's profession, it is likely that they lived in comfortable, middle-class conditions.

There is no evidence to suggest that the Dowland family was exceptionally wealthy, but as a merchant, Dowland's father would have been able to provide a comfortable living for his family. This is further supported by the fact that Dowland was able to receive an education, which was not a given for children of lower social classes in the 16th century. He was admitted to Christ's Hospital, a charitable school in London, in 1576. However, it's important to note that this education was not necessarily a result of his family's wealth, but rather their middle-class status and the charitable nature of the institution.

Furthermore, John Fletcher was educated at the prestigious Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which would have been unlikely if he came from a subsistence-level family.

His father, Anthony Petty, was a clothier by trade, which indicates a middle-class background. Clothiers were involved in the production and trade of cloth, a significant industry in England during the 17th century. This occupation would have provided a comfortable, though not luxurious, living for the Petty family. There is no evidence to suggest that the Petty family had any noble or aristocratic connections, nor were they impoverished. 

In terms of education, Petty was able to attend a free grammar school in Romsey, which suggests that his family had some level of social standing in the community.

His father, Featherstone Lake Osler, was a minister and missionary of the Church of England, while his mother, Ellen Free Picton, was the daughter of a naval officer.

William was the eighth of nine children, and his family valued education. His father, being a minister, would have had a good education and likely passed this value onto his children. William attended local schools and later the Toronto School of Medicine, suggesting that his family had enough resources to support his education.

Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modeling. She lived in Bern, Switzerland, for a time where Curtius was a physician. The family moved to Paris in 1765 where Curtius opened a cabinet de portraits en cire (wax portrait exhibition). While her father's occupation as a soldier might suggest a lower social class, her mother's employment and their relationship with Dr. Curtius, a skilled professional, suggest a middle-class standing. The family's move to Paris and the opening of a business also indicate a level of financial stability and social mobility.

Chamberlain's access to education was also indicative of his middle-class status.

However, this was not uncommon for middle-class families of the time, who often prioritized education as a means of social mobility.

In terms of housing and living conditions, it can be inferred that Chamberlain's family lived comfortably but not lavishly. As a naval officer, Thomas Chamberlain would have had a stable income, but not the wealth of the elite class.

This would have provided the family with a comfortable living, but not to the extent of the elite class. His mother, Mary Ann Saintsbury, was a homemaker. George was the youngest of six children. 

The family's middle-class status is further evidenced by George's access to education. He attended King Edward VI School, a grammar school in Southampton, and later studied at Merton College, Oxford. While it's not clear if his family's wealth specifically enabled his education, it's likely that their middle-class status made it more accessible.

His father, Abraham Dixon, was a merchant involved in the cotton industry, which was a booming industry in Manchester during this time. This suggests that the family was of the middle class, as merchants typically belonged to this social stratum. There is no evidence to suggest that the family was of the elite class, as they were not nobility or part of the ruling class. Similarly, they were not subsistence class, as Abraham Dixon's occupation as a merchant suggests a level of financial stability and resources beyond that of a laborer or peasant.

His father, also named George Chinnery, was a well-respected lawyer, which would have provided the family with a comfortable income. The Chinnery family was not part of the elite ruling class or nobility, but they were also not subsistence-level laborers or peasants.

There is no evidence to suggest that George Chinnery inherited any significant privileges or disadvantages due to his birth circumstances.

He was born into the Ibo tribe around 1745. His father was a local chieftain and decision-maker, but this does not equate to the wealth or status associated with the elite or middle classes in the United Kingdom during the same period. Equiano's early life was marked by hardship. At around the age of 11, he and his sister were kidnapped by local slave traders and sold into slavery. This traumatic event marked the end of his life in Africa and the beginning of his life as a slave, which would take him across the Atlantic to the Americas. As a slave, Equiano would have been considered part of the subsistence class, as he had minimal resources and was forced to labor for others.

His parents were Thomas Adams, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls. The occupation of his father as a tenant farmer suggests that the family was not part of the elite or subsistence classes, but rather the middle class. Tenant farming was a common occupation for middle-class individuals in the 19th century, as it required a certain level of skill and knowledge, but did not typically generate wealth on the scale of the elite class. 

Adams' access to education also suggests a middle-class upbringing. He was initially educated at home by his mother before attending several local schools. His family's ability to afford his education, albeit local schools, indicates a level of financial stability consistent with the middle class. 

Adams' early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his father's occupation, it's likely that they lived in a farmhouse or similar rural dwelling. This would be consistent with the living conditions of many middle-class families in rural England during this period.

In terms of inherited privileges or disadvantages, Adams did not inherit a title or significant wealth, which would be characteristic of the elite class. However, he also did not face the extreme poverty and lack of opportunity often experienced by the subsistence class.
