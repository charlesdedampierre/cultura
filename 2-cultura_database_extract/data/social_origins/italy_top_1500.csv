0,Q3080944,Francesco Alberti di Villanova,Q3080944,1737,Italy,,"Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to definitively classify the birth and childhood social class of Francesco Alberti di Villanova. The late 1700s in Italy was a time of significant social and economic change, and without specific details about Francesco's family background, it is difficult to accurately place him within the social structure of the time. Information about his parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages would be necessary to make a more informed classification.","While there are no specific sources available that provide this information, potential sources that could provide this information include church records, local historical archives, and genealogical databases. Additionally, scholarly research on the social structure of Italy in the late 1700s could provide some context for Francesco's potential social class."

Veronica's birth and childhood were marked by the privileges of the elite class. She lived in a noble household, likely in a large and well-appointed home. Her family's wealth and status would have provided her with access to resources and opportunities not available to those of lower social classes.

One of the most significant of these was education. Veronica was educated by private tutors, a luxury afforded only to the elite. Her education was comprehensive and included Latin, literature, and music, among other subjects. This level of education was not typical for women of the time, even those of the elite class, and speaks to the resources and values of her family.","- Robin, Diana Maury, Anne R.

Furthermore, Gaulli's early access to education was through the church, as he was taken in by the Jesuits after the death of his parents. This was a common practice for orphans of modest means during this period. While the Jesuits provided a good education, it was not the exclusive, private tutoring often afforded to children of the elite.

His father, Niccolò de Luteri, was a painter, and his brothers were also involved in the arts. This indicates that the family had enough resources to support artistic pursuits, which were not typically accessible to the subsistence class. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite or nobility. The family likely had some access to education, as evidenced by their involvement in the arts, but it is unclear to what extent.

His father, Filippo Fontana, was a stonemason, which would have placed the family within the middle class according to the social structure of 17th-century Italy. Stonemasonry was a skilled craft, and while it did not confer the same level of prestige or wealth as the professions of the elite class, it would have provided the family with a stable income and a certain level of social standing. The fact that Carlo Fontana was able to receive an education in the arts and architecture suggests that his family had the means to provide him with this opportunity, further supporting the classification of the family as middle class.

His father, Nicola Cuoco, was a notary, a profession that typically belonged to the middle class during this period.

This suggests that Vincenzo Cuoco's family had access to some resources and were not subsistence level. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite or nobility.

Tacca's access to education was likely limited to the training he received from his father and later in the workshop of the sculptor Giambologna, which he joined as an apprentice at the age of 15. This apprenticeship, while a significant opportunity, was a common practice for children of artisans and does not suggest an elite background.

Her early life housing and living conditions were modest but adequate, and she did not have any significant inherited privileges or disadvantages.

His father, Jacopo Bellini, was a prominent painter who had established a workshop in Venice, and his mother, Anna Rinversi, was also from a family of painters. This suggests that the Bellini family was part of the middle class, specifically skilled craftspeople. The family's wealth at the time of Gentile's birth and childhood would have been derived from their work as painters, which was a respected and well-paid profession in the 15th century. 

The Bellini family's social standing and occupation would have provided Gentile with access to education in the arts from a young age.

In terms of housing and living conditions, it can be inferred that the Bellini family lived comfortably, but not lavishly. As skilled craftspeople, they would have had a decent home, but not a palatial residence like the elite class. 

Gentile Bellini did not inherit any notable privileges or disadvantages due to his birth circumstances.

There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their time and place. Lorenzo's early access to education is unclear, but his later career as a painter suggests that he may have had some early training or exposure to the arts, which could have been facilitated by his family's middle-class status.

This suggests that the family was not of the subsistence class, as they had a trade, but also not of the elite class, as tailoring was not a profession associated with the nobility or ruling class. There is no specific information available about the family's wealth at the time of Gabbiani's birth and childhood, but it can be inferred from the father's occupation that they were likely of modest means. Gabbiani's access to education was also likely due to his family background, as he was apprenticed to a painter at a young age, a common practice for children of the middle class during this period. There is no information available about Gabbiani's early life housing and living conditions, but given his father's occupation, it is likely that they were adequate but not luxurious.

His father, Carl Friedrich Wagner, was a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and his mother, Johanna Rosine Wagner, was the daughter of a baker. After his father's death, his mother remarried to Ludwig Geyer, an actor and playwright. This indicates that Wagner's family was not part of the elite or subsistence classes, but rather the middle class, as they were engaged in skilled professions. Wagner's stepfather, Geyer, likely played a significant role in his early exposure to the arts, particularly theatre and music. Wagner attended the Kreuzschule in Dresden, indicating that his family had the means to provide him with an education, a privilege often associated with the middle class during this period.","""Richard Wagner: A Life in Music"" by Martin Geck (2013), ""Wagner Beyond Good and Evil"" by John Deathridge (2008), ""Richard Wagner: His Life, Art and Thought"" by Ronald Taylor (1979)."

His father, Ludovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, was a Florentine official with the title of the Judicial administrator, which was a middle-ranking official role. His family had lost much of its wealth by the time of Michelangelo's birth, but they still maintained an air of nobility due to their lineage tracing back to the counts of Canossa, a fact that Ludovico was very proud of. However, this ancestry did not translate into significant wealth or high social status at the time of Michelangelo's birth. 

Michelangelo's mother, Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena, died when he was six years old, after which he was placed in the care of a stonecutter's wife in the town of Settignano where he learned the basics of stonecutting and carving. This early exposure to the craft could be seen as a form of education, albeit not a formal one. 

In terms of housing and living conditions, Michelangelo likely lived in modest circumstances given his father's limited income. There is no evidence of any significant inherited privileges or disadvantages.","1. ""Michelangelo: A Biography"" by George Bull (1995)

Although the family was not wealthy, they were well-respected and belonged to the middle class. Vincenzo's profession as a musician and music theorist indicates a certain level of education and cultural capital, which is characteristic of the middle class. Galileo's mother, Giulia Ammannati, came from an ancient but not particularly distinguished noble family. 

The family's financial situation was not stable, and they often struggled with debt. However, despite their financial struggles, Galileo was able to receive an education.

The family was not of noble birth or particularly wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. 

Petrarch's access to education was a direct result of his family background. His father, recognizing his son's intellectual potential, sent him to study law in Montpellier and later in Bologna, which were among the best universities in Europe at the time. This level of education was not common among the lower classes and was usually reserved for those of middle or upper-class status.

The family lived in comfortable, if not luxurious, circumstances.

Raphael's mother, Magia di Battista Ciarla, came from a merchant family, further supporting the middle-class classification. Raphael's early access to education was likely due to his father's position and connections. Giovanni Santi was known to have taught his son painting techniques and principles, and Raphael may have also had access to the Duke's library, one of the finest in Italy.

His father, Pietro, was a successful sculptor and architect from Tuscany, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class. The middle class during this period was typically composed of skilled craftspeople, merchants, and professionals, which aligns with Pietro's occupation. There is no evidence to suggest that the Bernini family was part of the aristocracy or the subsistence class. The fact that Bernini was able to receive training in sculpture from his father also indicates that the family had some level of resources and access to education.

There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their time and place. Palladio's early education is not well-documented, but it is known that he was apprenticed to a stonecutter in Padua at the age of 13, which suggests that his family had enough resources to arrange for his vocational training but not enough to provide a more formal education.

931,Q42207,Caravaggio,Q42207,1571,Italy,Middle Class,"Caravaggio, born Michelangelo Merisi, was born in Milan, Italy, in 1571. His father, Fermo Merisi, was an architect and administrator for the Marchese of Caravaggio, a town from which the family took their name. His mother, Lucia Aratori, came from a propertied family of the same district. This suggests that Caravaggio's family was not of the elite nobility, but rather of the middle class, with occupations and property ownership common among this social stratum. The family's connection to the Marchese also suggests a level of social standing above the subsistence class. 

Caravaggio's early access to education is not well-documented, but his apprenticeship with the painter Simone Peterzano, a pupil of Titian, suggests that his family had the resources to secure such training. This is another indication of a middle-class background, as such opportunities were often beyond the reach of the subsistence class. 

Caravaggio's early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but his family's occupations and property ownership suggest a level of comfort above subsistence living.

This suggests that the Ficino family was not of the elite class, as they were in service to them, but they were also not subsistence level, as Diotifeci's profession as a physician required a significant level of education and skill. The family's connection to the Medici family likely provided Marsilio with access to education and resources beyond what would typically be available to the middle class.

Mantegna's father died when he was very young, which likely further strained the family's resources. Mantegna was later adopted by Francesco Squarcione, an artist who recognized his talent. However, this adoption was not due to family connections or wealth, but rather Squarcione's interest in Mantegna's artistic potential.

His mother, Ildegonda Celli, was from a family of rural bourgeoisie, which further supports the middle-class classification. The family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. Carducci's father's profession likely provided a stable income and a certain level of social standing within their community. 

As for education, Carducci's early access to education was largely due to his father, who was a man of letters and had a vast personal library. His father's influence and the resources available to him would have provided Carducci with a good education from a young age, a privilege often associated with the middle class. 

In terms of housing and living conditions, there is no evidence to suggest that Carducci grew up in either extreme wealth or poverty. His family likely lived in a comfortable home befitting their middle-class status.

Keats' parents were able to afford a good education for him. He attended the Clarke School in Enfield, a well-regarded school where he received a solid grounding in the classics and developed a love for literature. This access to education further supports the classification of Keats as middle class.

Keats' early life housing and living conditions were likely modest but comfortable, given his father's stable employment.

The family's wealth is not well-documented, but as successful painters, they likely had a comfortable living. Jacopo Bellini was one of the founders of the Renaissance style of painting in Venice and northern Italy, which suggests that he was successful and respected in his profession. 

Giovanni Bellini likely had access to education due to his family background. His father was his first teacher, and he later studied under his brother-in-law, the painter Andrea Mantegna.

This indicates a high social standing and access to political power. The Guicciardini family was also known to be wealthy, owning multiple properties in and around Florence. Francesco's access to education was likely due to his family's wealth and status, as he studied law at the universities of Ferrara and Padua, which were among the leading institutions of higher learning in Europe at the time.

This venture was successful, and by the time Alfred was nine years old, the family had risen to a comfortable middle-class status. Alfred's mother, Andriette Ahlsell Nobel, came from a wealthy family but her family's wealth did not significantly contribute to Alfred's upbringing due to their initial financial struggles.

Lorenzo's mother's background is not well-documented, but there is no evidence to suggest that she came from a higher or lower social class than her husband. The family likely had a comfortable, but not extravagant, lifestyle. Lorenzo's access to education would have been due to his family background, as his father would have been able to provide him with training in his craft.

This occupation would have provided a comfortable living, but not to the extent of the elite class. There is no evidence to suggest that Longhi's family was particularly wealthy or that they held any significant social standing beyond their trade.

His father, Giovanni Tempesta, was a successful artisan, specifically a tailor, which places the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. The tailoring profession was a skilled trade, often associated with the middle class in the late 16th century Italy. There is no evidence to suggest that the Tempesta family was part of the nobility or the subsistence class. 

In terms of education, Antonio Tempesta was apprenticed to the Flemish painter and engraver, Joannes Stradanus, at a young age. This suggests that his family had enough resources to secure an apprenticeship, a common practice among middle-class families who could afford to invest in their children's education and future.

Her early life housing and living conditions would have been luxurious, befitting her status as a member of the nobility. She would have grown up in grand palaces and estates, surrounded by servants and luxury.

In terms of inherited privileges, Vittoria would have benefited from her family's wealth, political influence, and social connections.

Her father, Cardinal Luigi d'Aragona, was a member of the Italian nobility and a high-ranking church official. Her mother, Giulia Ferrarese, was a courtesan, a position that, while stigmatized, was often held by educated and cultured women who had access to the upper echelons of society. Tullia's birth to a noble father and a courtesan mother placed her in a unique social position, with access to the privileges of the elite class, including education, wealth, and connections to powerful individuals. However, her illegitimate birth and her mother's profession may have also brought certain social disadvantages.

His father, Pietro Salvi, was a well-established lawyer, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class. The profession of law was typically associated with the middle class during this period in Italy, as it required a level of education and literacy not commonly accessible to the lower classes. While there is little specific information about Salvi's early life, his father's profession suggests that the family had a reasonable level of wealth and that Salvi likely had access to education. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was part of the elite or ruling class, nor that they were struggling for subsistence.","The primary source of information about Salvi's early life is the biography written by his contemporary, the art historian Luigi Crespi.

The specific details about his family background and early life are not well-documented, which is common for individuals from this period. However, considering the social structure and economic context of Florence in the late 14th century, it is reasonable to infer that Starnina was born into a middle-class family. Florence was a thriving center of commerce and art during this period, and the middle class, composed of merchants, artisans, and skilled craftspeople, was particularly prominent. Starnina's later career as a painter suggests that he likely came from an artisanal background, as the skills and training required for this profession were typically passed down through families and apprenticeships, which were accessible primarily to those in the middle class. It is also worth noting that access to education in this period was largely determined by social class, and Starnina's ability to read and write, as evidenced by his signed works, suggests that he likely had some form of education, further supporting the inference that he came from a middle-class background.","The primary sources for this period, including tax records, guild records, and notarial records, do not provide specific information about Starnina's family background.

Pitoni's early access to education also suggests a middle-class background. He studied music from a young age under the guidance of Francesco Anerio, a prominent Roman composer, which implies that his family had the resources to provide him with this education.

His father, Giovanni Grammatica, was a goldsmith, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class according to the social structure of late 16th-century Italy. Goldsmithing was a skilled craft, and while it did not confer the status of nobility or extreme wealth, it would have provided a comfortable living. There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or had access to significant resources beyond their immediate income. The family's social standing would have been respectable but not elite. As for education, it is likely that Grammatica would have had some access to education due to his family's middle-class status, but there is no specific evidence to confirm this. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical of a middle-class family of the time, likely living in a modest but comfortable home in the city. There is no evidence of any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","Primary sources on Antiveduto Grammatica's early life are scarce.

1476,Q1541765,Lauro Rossi,Q1541765,1812,Italy,Middle Class,"Lauro Rossi was born in Macerata, Italy, in 1812. His father, Pietro Rossi, was a horn player and his mother, Teresa Cappelletti, was a singer. This suggests that his family was involved in the arts, which was a common occupation for middle-class families during this period. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, which further supports the classification of middle class. Rossi's access to education also suggests a middle-class upbringing. He studied at the Naples Conservatory, a prestigious music school. While it's possible that he was admitted based on merit, his parents' involvement in the arts likely played a role in his acceptance. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his family's occupation and his access to education, it's reasonable to assume that they were adequate.

His family was not of noble or aristocratic descent, nor were they impoverished. His father, Bernardo Mancini, was a professional musician, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class, as musicians were typically considered skilled craftspeople during this time period. This profession would have provided a stable, albeit not extravagant, income for the family. Francesco's access to education was likely due to his father's profession, as it was common for children of musicians to receive musical training.

This indicates that his family was likely of the middle class, possibly involved in professions such as merchants, artisans, or teachers. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Marracci was born into the elite class, as there are no records of his family holding significant wealth, land, or titles of nobility.

The fact that Alvise followed in their footsteps and became a painter himself indicates that he likely had access to education and training in the arts from a young age.

The Albrizzi family was well-established in Venice, where they owned a printing press. This suggests that they had a certain level of wealth and social standing, but were not part of the aristocracy. The family's profession also implies that Giovanni Battista Albrizzi would have had access to education, as literacy and knowledge of the printing trade would have been necessary for the family business.
