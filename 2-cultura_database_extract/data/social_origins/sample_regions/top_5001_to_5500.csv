His father was named Lumbum Ghe, a Mongol leader of a small nomadic tribe, and his mother was called Shingza Acho.

His family belonged to the Haixi Jurchens, one of the three major groups of Jurchens as identified by the Ming dynasty.

His parents were farmers, which places them in the subsistence category. However, Zhu Zi's family was not entirely without resources. His family owned a small plot of land, which they farmed, and they were able to provide a basic education for Zhu Zi. This suggests that they were not the poorest of the poor, and might be considered lower middle class by the standards of the time. It's important to note that the social structure of China in the late 1300s was quite fluid due to the chaos and upheaval of the end of the Yuan dynasty, and the lines between social classes could be somewhat blurred. Nevertheless, Zhu Zi's family was not part of the ruling elite, nor were they wealthy merchants or landowners.
