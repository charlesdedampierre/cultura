His father, Carlo Parisio, was a lawyer and a member of the local nobility, indicating a high social standing. The Parisio family had a long history of serving in administrative and judicial roles, further suggesting their elite status. Pier Paolo's mother, Laura Bollati, also came from a noble family. This suggests that Pier Paolo had access to education due to his family background, as education during this period was primarily accessible to the nobility and the clergy. His family's wealth and status would have also provided him with a comfortable early life housing and living conditions.

His father, Michele di Giovanni, was a notary, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class according to the social structure of late 14th-century Italy. Notaries were skilled professionals who were responsible for drafting legal documents, a role that required literacy and a certain level of education. While not as wealthy or influential as the nobility, notaries were respected members of society and would have been able to provide a comfortable life for their families. Jacopo's access to education would have been due to his family's middle-class status, as education in this period was not universally accessible and was often limited to those with the means to afford it.

The Morosini family was one of the most important and influential families in Venice, with a long history of providing Doges, the highest-ranking officials in the Venetian Republic.

Furthermore, the fact that Luca was able to follow in his father's footsteps and become an engraver himself suggests that he had access to education and training, which would have been less likely if the family were subsistence-level laborers or peasants.
