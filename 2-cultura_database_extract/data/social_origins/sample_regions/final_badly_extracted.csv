His father, Emperor Wen of Sui, was the founder of the Sui Dynasty, and his mother, Empress Dugu, was of noble birth as well. This places Yang Guang firmly in the elite class of society. His family was wealthy and powerful, controlling the resources of the state. 

Yang Guang would have had access to the best education available at the time due to his family's status. As a member of the royal family, he would have been taught by private tutors and scholars, learning about literature, philosophy, and military strategy among other subjects. 

His early life housing and living conditions would have been luxurious, as befits a member of the royal family. He would have lived in the royal palace, with access to all the amenities and privileges that came with his status. 

Inherited privileges would have included his position in the line of succession for the throne, as well as the wealth and power that came with being a member of the royal family.","- ""The Cambridge History of China: Volume 3, Sui and T'ang China, 589-906 AD, Part One"" by Denis Twitchett
