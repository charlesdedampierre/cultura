The fact that Sallustio was able to study law at the University of Siena suggests that his family had the financial means to support his education, which was not a privilege available to everyone in late 17th-century Italy.

Goldsmithing was a skilled craft, and those who practiced it were typically considered part of the artisan class. This would have provided Langetti with a comfortable, though not luxurious, upbringing.

235,Q3613315,Altobello Persio,Q3613315,1507,Italy,Middle Class,"Altobello Persio was born in the town of Nicosia, Sicily, around 1507. His father, Giovanni Persio, was a notary, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class. Notaries in the 16th century Italy were considered part of the bourgeoisie, a social class composed of merchants, artisans, and professionals. They were not as wealthy as the nobility, but they had a comfortable living and were often educated. There is no evidence to suggest that Persio's family was exceptionally wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. Persio's access to education would have been due to his father's profession and status within the community. Notaries were literate and often ensured their children were educated as well. The family's living conditions would have been comfortable but not luxurious, in line with their middle-class status.","""Altobello Persio: A Forgotten Musician of the Late Renaissance"" by Dr. Robert Toft; ""The Notaries in the Kingdom of Sicily (1500-1600)"" by Salvatore Fodale."
