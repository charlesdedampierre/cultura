The scholar-official role also implies a certain level of social standing, as these officials were often respected members of their communities. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Liang Tingnan's family was part of the ruling class or nobility, so they would not be classified as elite.

484,Q45701566,Shuai Hanjie,Q45701566,1755,China,,"Unfortunately, there is not enough historical data or primary sources available to determine the social class and family background of Shuai Hanjie born around 1755 in what is now China. The name Shuai Hanjie does not appear in any known historical records, ancient texts, or scholarly references from the late 1700s in China. It is possible that the individual in question may have been a commoner or a person of non-elite status, as records from this period tend to focus on the activities and lives of the ruling class, nobility, and prominent scholars. However, without specific information about Shuai Hanjie's parents' occupations, family wealth, access to education, early life housing and living conditions, and inherited privileges or disadvantages, it is impossible to make a definitive classification.",N/A

486,Q845669,Xu Heng,Q845669,1209,China,Middle Class,"Xu Heng was born in 1209 in Suzhou, China. His family was not of the ruling class or nobility, but they were not peasants or laborers either. His father was a scholar-official, a position that required a certain level of education and was considered a respectable profession in the Song Dynasty. This suggests that Xu Heng's family was of the middle class, as scholar-officials were typically from families of merchants, artisans, or landowners. The fact that Xu Heng was able to receive an education from a young age also suggests that his family had some level of wealth and social standing, as education was not universally accessible in China at this time. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Xu Heng's family was particularly wealthy or that he inherited any significant privileges or disadvantages.","""Xu Heng and the Politics of Northern Song Loyalism,"" by Peter K.

His father was a local official, which suggests a middle-class background. The family was not part of the ruling elite or nobility, but they were also not subsistence farmers or laborers. Tu Long's access to education, which was common for children of officials and scholars, further indicates a middle-class upbringing. However, there is no evidence of significant family wealth or inherited privileges. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but it can be inferred from his father's occupation that they were likely modest but comfortable.","Primary sources on Tu Long's early life are scarce. However, general historical texts on the Ming Dynasty, such as ""The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644"" provide context for his social class. More specific information about his family background may be found in local historical records or genealogical research."

His father was a minor official, indicating a level of education and social standing above the subsistence level. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was part of the elite or nobility. The family's civil servant status would have likely provided Ren Renfa with access to education, a privilege not available to all during this time period.
