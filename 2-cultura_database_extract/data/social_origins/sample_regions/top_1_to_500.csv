His father, Domenico Galanti, was a notary, a profession that required literacy and legal knowledge, indicating a middle-class status. Notaries in the 18th century Italy were considered part of the bourgeoisie, a class of citizens who were neither aristocrats nor peasants. They were typically involved in commerce, industry, or professional occupations. This profession would have provided the family with a stable income, allowing them to live comfortably. Giuseppe's access to education, which was not common for lower classes at the time, further supports this classification.

His father, Giovanni Panizza, was a music teacher, which suggests that the family was of the middle class, as they had access to education and were involved in a skilled profession. There is no evidence to suggest that the Panizza family was of the elite class, as there are no records of them owning vast amounts of land or having any titles of nobility. Similarly, there is no indication that they were of the subsistence class, as Giovanni's profession as a music teacher would have provided a steady income for the family. Achille's early access to music education, which was likely due to his father's profession, further supports the classification of the family as middle class.","""Achille Panizza: un direttore d'orchestra italiano alla Scala di Milano e al Metropolitan di New York"" by Giuseppe Pugliese, 2002."
