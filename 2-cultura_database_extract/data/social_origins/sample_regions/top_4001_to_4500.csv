The Hori family was of the ""hatamoto"" rank, a middle-ranking samurai class who were direct vassals of the Shogun but did not have the wealth or power of the daimyo (feudal lords). Tatsunosuke's father was a samurai bureaucrat, a typical occupation for hatamoto. The family would have had a comfortable but not luxurious lifestyle, with a decent house and enough to eat, but they were not wealthy.

The samurai class in Japan during the Edo period (1603-1868) was a warrior class that served the daimyo (feudal lords) and the shogunate (military government). They were not as wealthy as the daimyo or the shogunate, but they were above the commoners in the social hierarchy. They were typically landowners and had access to education. Baien's father was a low-ranking samurai, and Baien himself was expected to follow in his father's footsteps. However, Baien showed an early interest in learning and was allowed to study under a Confucian scholar, which was a privilege not available to lower classes. This indicates that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education.","""Miura Baien: A Citizen of the Universe"" by Takeuchi Yoshimi (1979), ""The World of the Samurai: The Lives and Battles of Japan's Greatest Warriors"" by Stephen Turnbull (2011)."

His father was Iwai Hanshirō V, a renowned Kabuki actor of the time. Kabuki was a popular form of entertainment, and actors could earn a decent living, but they were not part of the ruling samurai class or the wealthy merchant class. They were, however, above the subsistence level, as they were skilled artisans in their craft. The family's wealth would have been moderate, enough to provide for their needs but not extravagant. As the son of a Kabuki actor, Hanshirō VI would have had access to education in the arts from a young age, but this was due to his family background, not his individual merit. His early life housing and living conditions would have been comfortable but not luxurious.

Although samurai families were not necessarily wealthy, they held a high social status and had certain privileges, such as the right to carry two swords.
