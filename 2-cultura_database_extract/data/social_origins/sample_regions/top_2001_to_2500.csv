The occupation of a schoolmaster was considered a respectable profession within the middle class during the late 18th century in the United Kingdom. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or that they were part of the elite class. The fact that Davies was able to receive an education and later attend Cambridge University suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education, a privilege not available to all during this period.

His father, Robert Dighton, was a well-known caricaturist and portrait painter, which suggests a middle-class background. The profession of an artist, particularly a successful one, would have provided a comfortable living, but not to the extent of the elite class. Richard Dighton would have had access to education, particularly in the arts, due to his family background. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he was born into significant wealth or inherited any titles, which would be indicative of an elite status.

His father, William Moncrieff, was a captain in the British Army, which suggests a middle-class background. Military officers during this period often came from the middle class, as they needed to purchase their commissions, which required some level of wealth but not the extensive wealth of the aristocracy. There is no evidence to suggest that the Moncrieff family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to conclude that they were middle class. The fact that William Thomas Moncrieff was able to become a playwright suggests that he had some access to education, which would also be consistent with a middle-class background.

This suggests that Duncan Forbes was born into a family of some means and social standing, but not necessarily of the elite aristocratic class.

His father, John Hunt, was a tinplate worker, a skilled trade that would have placed the family in the middle class. Tinplate workers were skilled craftsmen who worked with tin and other metals to create a variety of goods. This occupation would have provided a stable income for the family, allowing them to live comfortably but not extravagantly. There is no evidence to suggest that the family had significant wealth or owned large amounts of property, which would have been typical of the elite class. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was living in poverty or struggling to meet basic needs, which would have been typical of the subsistence class. 

In terms of education, it is known that Hunt was apprenticed to John Varley, a landscape painter, at a young age. This suggests that his family had the means to secure an apprenticeship for him, which would have been a significant investment. Apprenticeships were a common way for middle class families to provide their children with education and training in a specific trade.

Hunt's early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his father's occupation and the family's ability to secure an apprenticeship for him, it is reasonable to assume that they were living in decent conditions.

It would have provided a stable income and a certain level of social standing. The family would have had a comfortable home, likely within the church grounds, and Thomas would have had access to education, as it was common for the children of clergy to be educated.

332,Q1998583,Robert White,Q1998583,1538,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Robert White was born in Holborn, London, around 1538. His father, Robert White, was a gentleman and his mother, Agnes, was the daughter of a London merchant. This suggests that the family was of the middle class, as they were neither nobility nor laborers. The term ""gentleman"" during this period typically referred to a man of good family background, often with some land but not necessarily a large estate. The fact that his mother was the daughter of a merchant further supports this classification. 

In terms of education, White was a choirboy at Trinity College, Cambridge, which suggests that his family had the means to provide him with a good education. However, it's important to note that choirboys were often from a variety of social backgrounds, and their position was more often due to their musical talent than their social standing.
