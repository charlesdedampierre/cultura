His father, James Warner, was a successful merchant, which indicates a middle-class standing. The family's wealth, derived from James's business, would have provided Charles with a comfortable upbringing, including access to education. There is no evidence to suggest that the family lived in poverty or that Charles was subjected to any inherited disadvantages. However, they were not part of the elite ruling class or nobility, which is why they are classified as middle class.","The primary source for this information is the 1851 England Census, which lists James Warner's occupation and provides a snapshot of the family's living conditions.

His mother, Mary Lago, was reputedly of noble stock, but her marriage to a weaver would have placed her in the same social class as her husband. Fox's parents were ""honest and upright people"" according to Fox's own writings, indicating a level of respectability and stability. Fox had some basic education, as he was literate, but did not attend university. This suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with a basic education, but not enough to send him to university, further supporting the classification of his family as middle class.

109,Q18730199,Edward Crace,Q18730199,1725,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Edward Crace was born into a family of tradesmen. His father, John Crace, was a successful upholsterer in London, which suggests a middle-class background. Upholstery was a skilled trade, and while not as prestigious as the professions or as wealthy as the merchant class, it would have provided a comfortable living. The family's wealth at the time of Edward's birth and childhood is not well-documented, but it is reasonable to infer from John Crace's occupation that they were not impoverished. Edward likely had access to some education, as literacy and numeracy would have been important skills in his father's trade. The family's housing and living conditions would have been typical of the urban middle class in 18th-century London, likely a comfortable home in a decent neighborhood. Edward would not have inherited any titles or lands, but he would have had the advantage of his father's trade and business connections.","The primary source for this information is the Crace family papers, held by the British Library. These include business records, correspondence, and other documents that provide insight into the family's social and economic status.

His father, Isaac Rand Sr., was a merchant and a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, one of the most powerful of the city's livery companies. This suggests that the family was of the middle class, as merchants typically fell into this category during the late 17th century. The family's membership in the Worshipful Company of Mercers also implies a certain level of wealth and social standing, as these organizations were often exclusive and required members to pay fees. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Rands were part of the elite ruling class or nobility.

There is no evidence to suggest that the Eddis family had any aristocratic connections or inherited wealth, which rules out the elite classification. Similarly, there is no indication that they were living in poverty or working in unskilled labor, which rules out the subsistence classification. Edward's access to education would have been due to his family's middle-class status, as education during this period was often limited to those who could afford it.
