However, there is no evidence to suggest that Bandō Shūka I's family was particularly wealthy or influential within the merchant class. As for education, it is known that Bandō Shūka I was apprenticed to the kabuki actor Bandō Mitsugorō III at a young age, which suggests that his family had enough resources to secure such an apprenticeship, but does not necessarily indicate a high level of formal education.

His father, Namikawa Kichibei, was a craftsman who specialized in making metal tobacco pipes, a trade that was considered skilled work and would place the family in the middle class according to the given typology. The family was not of aristocratic or samurai lineage, nor were they peasants or laborers, which rules out the elite and subsistence classifications. The family's trade would have provided a stable income, but not to the extent of significant wealth. As a craftsman's son, Ihachi would have had access to education in his father's trade from an early age, but there is no evidence to suggest he received a formal education beyond this.

490,Q927161,Nakahara Nantenbo,Q927161,1839,Japan,Middle Class,"Nakahara Nantenbo was born as Nakahara Tetsugoro in 1839 in what is now Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. His father was a samurai, which was a social class of military nobility in Japan. However, during the late Edo period, many samurai families were not wealthy, and their status was more akin to a middle-class standing in the society of the time. The samurai class was characterized by their right to bear arms and their dedication to the values of martial arts and discipline, but they were not necessarily affluent. Nantenbo's family was of the same ilk, with a respectable social standing but not significant wealth. Nantenbo's access to education was also typical of the samurai class, as he was trained in the martial arts from a young age. His early life housing and living conditions would have been modest but comfortable, reflecting the status of his family.","""Nakahara Nantenbo: The Great Zen Master of Meiji Japan"" by Yoko Hayashi, ""Samurai: The World of the Warrior"" by Stephen Turnbull."
491,Q98167756,Sawamura Sōjūrō V,Q98167756,1802,Japan,Middle Class,"Sawamura Sōjūrō V was born into a family of kabuki actors, a profession that was considered respectable and required a certain level of skill and talent. His father, Sawamura Sōjūrō III, was a well-known kabuki actor of his time. While not wealthy aristocrats, the family would have been considered middle class due to their profession. The kabuki theater was a popular form of entertainment in Japan during the Edo period, and actors could earn a decent living. However, they were not considered part of the elite class, which was reserved for samurai, daimyo, and the imperial family. The family's social standing would have provided Sawamura Sōjūrō V with access to education in the arts, specifically kabuki acting, from a young age. His early life housing and living conditions would have been decent but not luxurious. As a member of a kabuki acting family, he would have inherited certain privileges, such as access to the theater community and training in the arts, but also faced disadvantages, such as societal prejudice against actors.","""Kabuki: A World of Tradition and Innovation"" by Toshio Kawatake; ""The World of the Kabuki Actor"" by Faubion Bowers; ""Actors' Analects (Yakusha Rongo)"" by Chikamatsu Monzaemon."

His father, Torii Kiyomasu I, was a prominent ukiyo-e artist who had established the Torii school of art. The Torii school was closely associated with the kabuki theater, creating many of the promotional posters and billboards for the popular performances. This connection to the theater industry would have provided the family with a significant income and social standing. 

In terms of education, Kiyonobu II would have had access to high-quality training in the arts from a young age due to his family background. The Torii family's status as established artists would have ensured that he received a comprehensive education in the family trade.

The family's wealth and social standing would have also ensured that Kiyonobu II lived in comfortable conditions during his early life. The Torii family's close ties with the kabuki theater would have also granted them certain privileges, such as access to the elite circles of the theater industry.","- ""Torii Kiyonobu II.""

During this time, the social structure was rigidly hierarchical, with samurai at the top, followed by farmers, artisans, and merchants. Gidayū's family was of the chōnin (townspeople) class, which included both artisans and merchants. His father was a maker of bamboo blinds, a skilled craft that would have placed the family in the middle class. While there is not much information about his family's wealth, it can be inferred that they had enough resources to provide Gidayū with an education, as he was known to have studied under a Buddhist priest in his early years. This suggests that his family had some means, as education during this period was not universally accessible and often required resources. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or that he had any inherited privileges.","""Gidayū-bushi"", Encyclopedia of Japan (Kodansha, 1993); ""The World of the Chōnin: The Cultural Milieu of Chikamatsu's Puppet Theater"", C.
