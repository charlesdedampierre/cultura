The Kanze family was part of the sarugaku Noh tradition, a form of theater that was patronized by the elite classes of Japanese society, including the shogunate and the imperial court. This suggests that Nobumitsu was born into a family of high social standing. Furthermore, the fact that Nobumitsu was able to become a Noh actor and playwright suggests that he had access to education and training in the arts, which would have been difficult for those of lower social classes to obtain. The Kanze family's involvement in the Noh tradition also suggests that they had a certain degree of wealth, as Noh theater was a costly endeavor that required significant resources to produce.","""The Noh Drama: Ten Plays from the Japanese"" by Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkōkai, ""Noh and Kyogen in the Contemporary World"" by James R.
