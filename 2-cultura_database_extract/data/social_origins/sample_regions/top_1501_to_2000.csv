0,Q5331349,Eaton Faning,Q5331349,1850,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Eaton Faning was born in 1850 in Norwich, England. His father, John Faning, was a boot and shoe manufacturer, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class during the mid-19th century. This is because the shoe manufacturing industry was a thriving sector during the Industrial Revolution, providing a decent income for those involved. The family's middle-class status is further evidenced by the fact that Eaton Faning was able to attend Norwich School, a well-regarded institution that would have required some level of financial means to attend. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Faning family was part of the elite ruling class or nobility, nor were they subsistence laborers or peasants.","Census records from the mid-19th century, Norwich School records, and historical texts on the shoe manufacturing industry during the Industrial Revolution."

480,Q332449,William Blackstone,Q332449,1723,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Sir William Blackstone was born in London in 1723 to Charles Blackstone and Mary Blackstone. His father, Charles, was a silk merchant, which suggests that the family was of the middle class, as they were involved in trade. Unfortunately, both of his parents died early in his childhood, leaving him and his brother in the care of their maternal uncle, Dr. Thomas Bigg. Dr. Bigg was a physician, which further supports the classification of Blackstone's family as middle class. Blackstone's uncle was able to provide him with access to education, and he attended Charterhouse School before going on to study at Pembroke College, Oxford. This suggests that the family had enough wealth to afford a good education, but it does not necessarily indicate that they were part of the elite class, as education was also accessible to the middle class during this period.","""Sir William Blackstone.""
