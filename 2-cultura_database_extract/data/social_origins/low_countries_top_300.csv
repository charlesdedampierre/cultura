Similarly, there is no indication that Blaeu's family was struggling to meet basic needs, as would be typical of the subsistence class.

His father, Cornelis van Mander, was a miller by trade, which would place the family in the middle class according to the typology provided. Millers were skilled craftspeople and often owned their own mills, which would have provided a steady income and a comfortable living for the family. Karel's mother, Johanna van der Gheynst, was from a family of weavers, another skilled craft that would have been considered middle class. Karel was one of six children, and the family lived in a house in the village, suggesting that they were not impoverished. 

Karel received an education, which suggests that his family had the means to pay for schooling. He was sent to Ghent to study under Lucas de Heere, a well-known painter and poet. This would have been a significant expense for the family, further suggesting that they were not subsistence level. 

However, there is no evidence to suggest that Karel's family was part of the elite. They were not nobility, and there is no record of them owning large amounts of land or having significant wealth.","- ""Karel van Mander: His Life and Work"" by Hessel Miedema

Boerhaave's mother, Hagar Daelder, was the daughter of a notary, which also suggests a middle-class background. The family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either.

His father's occupation as an oil mill owner indicates that the family was likely of the middle class, as they were engaged in a skilled trade and owned their own business. This would have provided a stable income and a comfortable lifestyle, but not to the extent of the elite class. The fact that they were Mennonites also suggests they were not part of the ruling class, as this religious group was often persecuted and marginalized during this period. There is no evidence to suggest that van der Heyden had access to formal education due to his family background, but his father's trade would have provided him with practical skills and knowledge.

This indicates that his family had a stable income and were not subsistence laborers or peasants. There is no evidence to suggest that his family was part of the elite or nobility. As for education, it is known that Aertsen was apprenticed to Allaert Claesz, a painter, which was a common practice for middle-class families to provide their children with education and training in a trade.

After the death of his parents, Caspar and his siblings were taken in by a soldier named Wolfert Dircksz, who brought them to Arnhem, Netherlands. There, Caspar was placed under the care of a local portrait painter, Hendrick Coster.

This suggests that the family had some level of wealth and social standing, but not to the extent of the elite or nobility. The fact that Boetius and his brother, Schelte à Bolswert, both became engravers suggests they had access to education and training in the arts, which would have been less likely for a subsistence-level family.

His father, Jean Du Pont, was a bookbinder and bookseller, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. This is because bookbinding and bookselling were skilled trades, which required a certain level of education and literacy. The Du Pont family would have had a moderate level of wealth, enough to provide for their basic needs and some comforts, but not to the extent of the elite class. Paulus Pontius was able to receive an education, likely due to his family's middle-class status, as he was apprenticed to the engraver Osias Beert when he was around 14 years old.

Salomon and his brother Isaack took on the surname ""van Ruysdael"" from the castle they drew in their youth, indicating that they had some access to education and leisure time, which was not common for lower classes.

This indicates that the family had a significant social standing in their community. 

Johan de Witt's family was wealthy enough to provide him with a good education. He studied at the Latin school in Dordrecht before going on to study at the University of Leiden, one of the most prestigious universities in Europe at the time.

Furthermore, Eeckhout was able to study under Rembrandt from a young age, indicating that his family had the means to provide him with a good education.

There is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume they were of average means for their social class. Junius' access to education, which included studying at the University of Louvain, was likely due to his father's profession and the value placed on education in middle-class families during this period.

His father, Jan Jansz van de Passe, was a local fisherman, a profession that would have placed the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the Netherlands in the late 1500s. The fishing industry was a significant part of the Dutch economy, and while it did not provide the wealth of the elite class, it did afford a comfortable living for those involved. There is no evidence to suggest that the family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, suggesting a middle-class upbringing. 

As for education, it is known that Crispijn was apprenticed to a local goldsmith at a young age. This suggests that his family had enough resources to secure an apprenticeship, a common practice among the middle class of the time. The fact that he was apprenticed to a goldsmith, a skilled and respected profession, further supports the classification of his family as middle class.

This suggests that they were not part of the ruling elite, who would have had more protection from religious persecution. However, they also were not subsistence level, as they had the means to relocate and establish a new life in Amsterdam.

Johannes Reland's profession as a minister would have provided a stable income and a certain level of social standing within their community. The fact that Adriaan Reland was able to attend the Latin School in Amsterdam at a young age suggests that his family had the means to provide him with a good education, a privilege typically associated with the middle class.

The Ryckaert family was well-established in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke, a guild for painters and other artists, indicating a level of professional and social standing within the community. This suggests that the family had a comfortable income and were part of the middle class, which included skilled craftspeople like artists. However, there's no evidence to suggest they were part of the elite or subsistence classes.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Ochtervelt family was part of the elite ruling class or nobility. Similarly, there is no indication that they were subsistence-level laborers or peasants.

His father, David Lingelbach, was a merchant, which suggests that the family belonged to the middle class. Merchants were typically part of the middle class in the 17th century Netherlands, as they had a stable income but did not possess the wealth or status of the aristocracy. There is no evidence to suggest that Lingelbach's family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they lived comfortably but not luxuriously.

The family's ability to maintain a publishing business also suggests a degree of wealth and stability, further supporting a middle-class classification. Henricus' access to education would likely have been due to his family background, as his father would have been able to provide him with training in engraving and cartography.

This suggests that the Lombard family was part of the middle class, as they were not nobility or aristocrats, but they were also not laborers or peasants. The family's middle-class status is further supported by the fact that Lambert Lombard was able to receive an education, as he was sent to study Latin and the humanities at the age of twelve. This suggests that the Lombard family had enough wealth to afford an education for their son, which was not a privilege available to all families during this time period.
