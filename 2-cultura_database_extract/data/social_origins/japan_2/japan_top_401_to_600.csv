The samurai class, which Tanzan was born into, was the ruling military class and the highest-ranking social caste of the Edo Period in Japan. This class had access to education, wealth, and privileges that were not available to the lower classes. The samurai lived in their own separate, privileged world. They had the right to carry two swords and had a monopoly on military service. They were also the only class allowed to ride horses. The samurai class was also known for their strict adherence to the code of Bushido, which emphasized honor, loyalty, and martial arts skills.","""The Making of Modern Japan"" by Marius B.

His father was a farmer, which was a common occupation for the middle class in Japan during this time. Farming was a respected profession and provided a stable income, but it did not afford the same level of wealth or prestige as the elite class. There is no evidence to suggest that Toda's family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume that they were of average means for their social class. As for education, it is known that Toda learned to read and write at a young age, which suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with a basic education. This is consistent with the middle class status, as education was not universally accessible in Japan during this period, particularly for the lower classes. Toda's early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his family's occupation, it is likely that they lived in a rural area in a house suitable for a farming family.

187,Q11553742,Kawai Chigetsu,Q11553742,1633,Japan,Middle Class,"Kawai Chigetsu was born into a family of samurai, a class that was considered part of the middle class in Japan during the Edo period. Samurai were not nobility, but they were not peasants either. They were a warrior class, often serving as local officials, teachers, and administrators. Chigetsu's father, Kawai Sadataka, was a samurai and a retainer of the Tokugawa shogunate, indicating a certain level of social standing and wealth. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was exceptionally wealthy or part of the elite class. The samurai class typically had access to education, and it is likely that Chigetsu would have been educated in martial arts, literature, and the arts, as was common for samurai children. The family would have lived in a samurai residence, which would have been comfortable but not opulent. As a samurai, Chigetsu would have inherited certain privileges, such as a stipend from the shogunate and a certain level of social respect, but she would also have been subject to the strict moral and behavioral codes of the samurai class.","""The World of the Samurai: The Warrior Culture of Japan"" by H.

Yukoku's family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either.

193,Q2880018,Baiōken Eishun,Q2880018,1650,Japan,Middle Class,"Baiōken Eishun was born into a family of artisans, specifically his father was a painter. This places him in the middle class according to the provided typology, as artisans are included in this category.

While there is little specific information about Eishun's family wealth at the time of his birth and childhood, it can be inferred that they had enough resources to provide him with an education in painting, as this was not a skill typically self-taught during this period. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical of the chōnin class, likely living in a modest home in an urban area.
