His father, Hosoi Heishu, was a Confucian scholar and a teacher, which would place their family in the middle class according to the provided typology. The middle class in Japan during this period consisted of merchants, artisans, skilled craftspeople, landowners, and teachers. As the son of a scholar, Kōtaku likely had access to education due to his family background. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Hosoi family was particularly wealthy or that they lived in luxurious conditions. They were not part of the ruling class or nobility, and they were not subsistence-level laborers or peasants. Therefore, the most accurate classification for Kōtaku's birth and childhood social class would be middle class.","""Hosoi Heishu and His Two Sons: A Study of a Confucian Family in Early Modern Japan"" by Kate Wildman Nakai, The Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Winter, 1981), pp. 71-99."

His father, Amenomori Nobutoki, was a samurai and a scholar. The samurai class, while not as wealthy as the daimyo (feudal lords), were still considered part of the ruling class in Japan during this period. However, they were not as affluent as the elite class, which consisted of the shogun and daimyo. Samurai families, like Hōshū's, typically had access to education and were often literate, as their role included administrative duties in addition to their military ones. Therefore, Hōshū would have had access to education due to his family background. The samurai class also lived in better conditions than the lower classes, but their lifestyle was not as lavish as that of the elite class.","""Amenomori Hoshu: An Edo Period Diplomat,"" by Beatrice M.

2,Q6561857,Kaiho Seiryō,Q6561857,1755,Japan,Middle Class,"Kaiho Seiryō was born into a samurai family in the late Edo period. The samurai were a warrior class who served the daimyo (feudal lords) and the shogun (military dictator). They were part of the ruling class but not necessarily wealthy, as their status was more about honor and duty than wealth. However, they were above the commoners (farmers, artisans, and merchants) in the social hierarchy. Seiryō's father was a low-ranking samurai, which suggests that they were not particularly wealthy. There is no specific information about Seiryō's early life housing and living conditions, but as a samurai family, they would have had a certain level of comfort and respectability.

3,Q6565667,Yamada Hōkoku,Q6565667,1805,Japan,Middle Class,"Yamada Hōkoku was born into a samurai family in the late Edo period. The samurai were a warrior class that made up about 10% of Japan's population, and they were considered part of the ruling class. However, by the late Edo period, many samurai families, especially those in rural areas, were in financial difficulty due to a stagnant economy and the burden of maintaining their status. Therefore, while Hōkoku's family was of a high social standing, they were likely not particularly wealthy. As a samurai, Hōkoku would have had access to education, as literacy and knowledge of the arts were considered important for members of this class.

The Kondō family was not particularly wealthy, but they had a stable income from their service to the shogunate. Jūzō's access to education was likely due to his family's status as samurai, as samurai children were typically educated in martial arts and other subjects.

His father, Kanō Jirōsaku, was an adopted son who had married into the family and taken over the family business. The family was not part of the ruling class or nobility, but they were not subsistence laborers either. They had a stable income from their sake brewing business, which allowed them to live comfortably and provide education for their children. Kanō Jigorō was able to attend a private school because of his family's economic status. The family lived in a house in Mikage, a small town near Kobe, which indicates that they had a decent standard of living.

His father, Motoori Norinaga, was a well-known scholar of the Kokugaku school, but his primary occupation was as a physician. This suggests that the family had a stable income and were of the middle class, as both sake brewing and medicine were skilled professions. The family's wealth and status would have provided Haruniwa with access to education, as evidenced by his father's scholarly pursuits. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was part of the elite ruling class or nobility, nor that they were subsistence laborers or peasants.

There is no evidence to suggest that Suian's family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it can be inferred that they were of average means for their social class.

The merchant class, while technically lower in the Confucian hierarchy than samurai, farmers, and artisans, often had considerable wealth due to the economic growth during the Edo period. However, there is no specific evidence to suggest that Baigai's family was exceptionally wealthy, so it is safe to classify them as middle class.

His father, Takahashi Sakuzaemon, was a samurai in the service of the Tokugawa shogunate, the feudal military government of Japan. Samurai families were part of the elite class, as they were the warrior nobility and ruling class of the time. They had access to education, as it was considered essential for their role in society. The samurai class was also known for their wealth and land ownership, which suggests that Kageyasu's family was financially stable. His early life housing and living conditions would have been comfortable, as samurai families typically lived in well-built houses.

176,Q11675017,Chokyosai Eiri,Q11675017,1759,Japan,Middle Class,"Chokyosai Eiri, also known as Shunkosai Hokushu, was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist, born around 1759. Ukiyo-e was a genre of Japanese art which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties, kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers, scenes from history and folk tales, travel scenes and landscapes, flora and fauna, and erotica. 

While there is limited information available about Eiri's early life, it is known that he was a pupil of the ukiyo-e artist Eishi. This suggests that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education in the arts, which was not a privilege accessible to everyone in the society of the time. This indicates that Eiri likely came from a middle-class background, as the arts were often pursued by those in the merchant class.

However, it should be noted that the social structure of Japan during this period was complex and fluid. The merchant class, despite being economically prosperous, was considered low in the social hierarchy, beneath the samurai, farmers, and artisans. Yet, they often had more actual wealth than the samurai class, who were technically above them. This makes it difficult to classify Eiri's social class according to Western standards.","- ""Ukiyo-e."" Encyclopædia Britannica. https"
