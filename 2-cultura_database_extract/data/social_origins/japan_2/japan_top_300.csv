0,Q5586,Katsushika Hokusai,Q5586,1760,Japan,Middle Class,"Katsushika Hokusai was born in the Katsushika district of Edo (modern Tokyo). His father was Nakajima Ise, a mirror-maker for the shogun. This occupation placed the family in the artisan class, which was considered part of the middle class in the social hierarchy of the Edo period. The family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. Hokusai's access to education was likely due to his family's middle-class status, as he was apprenticed to a wood-carver at the age of 14 and later entered the studio of the ukiyo-e painter Katsukawa Shunshō. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical of the middle class in Edo Japan, which was characterized by urban living in relatively comfortable, if not luxurious, circumstances.

1,Q200798,Utagawa Hiroshige,Q200798,1797,Japan,Middle Class,"Utagawa Hiroshige, also known as Andō Hiroshige, was born in Edo (now Tokyo), Japan, in 1797. His father, Andō Gen'emon, was a member of the fire-fighting organization responsible for protecting Edo Castle, the residence of the shogun. This role was hereditary and considered a samurai rank, which placed Hiroshige's family in the middle class, according to the social structure of Japan in the late 1700s. However, they were not wealthy. After his parents' death, Hiroshige took over his father's role at a young age, but he also showed an early interest in art and managed to get an apprenticeship with Utagawa Toyohiro, a renowned ukiyo-e artist. This suggests that his family had enough resources to support his education in art, further indicating a middle-class status. His early life housing and living conditions would have been modest but comfortable, typical of the samurai class of the time.","""Hiroshige: From Fireman's Son to Ukiyo-e Master"" by Henry D.

2,Q5676,Matsuo Bashō,Q5676,1644,Japan,Middle Class,"Matsuo Bashō was born in Ueno, in Iga Province, Japan. His father was a low-ranking samurai, which would place the family in the middle class according to the social structure of Japan in the late 1600s. Samurai were considered part of the ruling class, but their wealth and influence varied greatly. Bashō's family was not wealthy, but they had enough resources to provide him with a solid education, which was a privilege not available to everyone in that era. Bashō's father's position would have provided the family with a certain level of social standing and stability, but not with the wealth and influence of the higher-ranking samurai or nobility.

3,Q313638,Lafcadio Hearn,Q313638,1850,Japan,Middle Class,"Lafcadio Hearn was born on June 27, 1850, in and on the Greek island of Lefkada. His father, Charles Bush Hearn, was an Irish surgeon in the British army, and his mother, Rosa Antoniou Kassimati, was a native Greek woman. His parents' marriage was not accepted by the Victorian society of the time, and after his father was called back to Ireland, Lafcadio was left in the care of a great-aunt in Dublin. This indicates that while his father had a respectable profession, the family was not part of the elite class. His childhood was marked by neglect and poverty, especially after his great-aunt's death. However, he was able to attend a Catholic boarding school, Ushaw College, indicating some access to education.

4,Q272045,Kitagawa Utamaro,Q272045,1754,Japan,Middle Class,"Kitagawa Utamaro was born around 1754 in Edo, Japan. His exact family background is not well-documented, but it is generally accepted that he was born into a middle-class family. His father, Kitagawa Ichitaro, is believed to have been a member of the town's yoshiya, or teahouse owners, which would place the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. This class included merchants and artisans, among others. The teahouse culture was a significant part of the urban culture in Edo period, and owners of such establishments were considered respectable middle-class citizens. However, there is no concrete evidence of the family's wealth or Utamaro's early life housing and living conditions. As for education, Utamaro likely had access to some form of education due to his family's status, as he was able to read and write, but the specifics are not known.","""Utamaro and the Spectacle of Beauty"" by Julie Nelson Davis; ""The Passionate Art of Kitagawa Utamaro"" by Asano Shugo and Timothy Clark."
5,Q193344,Miyamoto Musashi,Q193344,1585,Japan,Middle Class,"Miyamoto Musashi was born in Harima Province, Japan, around 1584. His father, Shinmen Munisai, was an accomplished martial artist and master of the sword and jitté (a specialized weapon for defeating swords). Munisai had an official role as the martial arts instructor for the Ashikaga lords of the shogunate, a position of considerable prestige. This suggests that Musashi was born into a family with a respectable social standing, but not into the ruling class or nobility. 

Musashi's early access to martial arts training, presumably from his father, indicates a degree of educational opportunity not available to those of lower social classes. However, there's no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or that he had access to the broader academic education typically associated with the elite class.

Musashi's mother died shortly after his birth, and his father either died or abandoned him when he was around seven years old. He was raised by his uncle, a monk, which suggests that his living conditions were likely modest.","""The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi"" by William Scott Wilson; ""Miyamoto Musashi: His Life and Writings"" by Kenji Tokitsu."

Kuniyoshi was not born into a samurai family or the ruling class, which rules out the elite classification. He also was not born into a subsistence-level family, as his father's occupation provided a stable income.

However, his father died when Buson was still young, and his mother took him to live in the city of Kyoto, where he would have been exposed to the cultural and artistic life of the city.

This class was composed of non-samurai urban dwellers, including merchants and artisans. Despite the social restrictions of the time, the chōnin class had access to certain forms of education and could accumulate wealth, although they were socially below the samurai class. Akinari's adoptive father was a successful oil wholesaler, suggesting a degree of wealth and stability in the family.

They were not aristocrats, but they were above the commoners in the social hierarchy. They had access to education and were expected to be literate and knowledgeable in the arts. Yōsai's father was a scholar, which suggests that the family valued education and likely provided Yōsai with a good education from a young age.

In the Edo period, ukiyo-e artists were not considered high class, but they were not subsistence level either. They had a certain level of social standing and economic stability, as their work was in demand among the merchant class and the urban population.

276,Q11537539,Kuwayama Gyokushū,Q11537539,1746,Japan,Middle Class,"Kuwayama Gyokushū, also known as Kuwayama Gyokushū II, was born into a family of artists in Edo (now Tokyo), Japan. His father, Kuwayama Gyokushū I, was a well-known painter of the Kano school, which was a dominant style in Japanese painting from the late 15th to the late 19th century. The Kano school was patronized by the shogunate, the military government of Japan, and the daimyos, the feudal lords. However, the artists themselves were not considered part of the ruling class or nobility. They were more akin to skilled craftspeople or artisans, which would place them in the middle class according to the typology provided. As the son of a Kano school painter, Kuwayama Gyokushū II would have had access to education in the arts from an early age. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or that he lived in luxurious conditions. His family's status as artists would have provided him with certain privileges, such as access to education and patronage, but also with certain disadvantages, such as the expectation to follow in his father's footsteps and the pressure to uphold the family's artistic reputation.","""Kano School.""
