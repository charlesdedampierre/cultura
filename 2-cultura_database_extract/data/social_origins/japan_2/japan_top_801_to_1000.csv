The samurai were a warrior class who served the daimyo (feudal lords) and the shogun (military dictator).

In the case of Fujii Ikko, specific details about her family's wealth and living conditions are not readily available, but as a samurai family, they would have had a certain level of social standing and access to education. Samurai children were typically educated in the martial arts, as well as in literature, ethics, and other academic subjects. However, the late Edo period was a time of economic hardship and social upheaval, and many samurai families fell into poverty.
