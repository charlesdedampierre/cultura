0,Q11457596,Jitsukawa Gakujūrō II,Q11457596,1813,Japan,Middle Class,"Jitsukawa Gakujūrō II, born as Katsujiro, was the son of a samurai family in the late Edo period. His father was a low-ranking samurai, which placed them in the middle class of Japanese society at the time. Samurai were considered part of the ruling class, but their actual wealth and living conditions varied greatly. Lower-ranking samurai like Gakujūrō's father often lived modestly. They were not wealthy, but they had a certain level of social prestige and access to education. Gakujūrō would have been expected to follow in his father's footsteps and become a samurai, but he chose to become a kabuki actor instead. His family background would have given him access to education and a relatively comfortable early life, but he would not have been considered part of the elite.","""Kabuki, a Mirror of Japan: Ten Plays that Offer a Glimpse into Evolving Sensibilities"" by Toshio Kawatake; ""The World of the Meiji Print: Impressions of a New Civilization"" by Julia Meech-Pekarik."

His father was a merchant dealing in paper and books, which suggests a certain level of wealth and status, but not to the extent of the elite class.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that Rekidō's family was particularly wealthy or that they lived in luxurious conditions. The family's merchant status would have provided them with a certain level of comfort and security, but they would not have had the same level of privilege as the ruling class.","""Abei Rekidō: His Life and Thought"" by Katsuhiro Sano, ""The World of the Meiji Print: Impressions of a New Civilization"" by Julia Meech-Pekarik."
2,Q11439620,Ōno Bunsen,Q11439620,1774,Japan,Middle Class,"Ōno Bunsen was born into a samurai family in the late 18th century Japan.

However, by the 18th century, the samurai class had become largely bureaucratized and many samurai families, like Bunsen's, were not particularly wealthy. They were, however, educated and literate, as these were valued traits among the samurai. Bunsen's father was a low-ranking samurai and his mother was from a family of merchants, which places them in the middle class according to the given typology. Bunsen's family was not wealthy, but they were not subsistence level either. They had a house and enough to live on, but they were not part of the elite.

His father, Nakamura Noshio I, was a well-known kabuki actor. Although not aristocratic, kabuki actors were part of the chonin class, which was essentially the urban middle class of the time. They were not wealthy, but they had a stable income and were respected for their craft. As the son of a kabuki actor, Nakamura Noshio II would have had access to education in the form of training in the arts, specifically kabuki theater. The family's living conditions would have been modest but comfortable, reflecting their middle-class status. However, as actors, they were subject to certain restrictions and prejudices, which can be considered as inherited disadvantages.","Kabuki: A Pocket Guide by Ronald Cavaye, Kabuki: A Literary and Social History by James R.

During the Edo period (1603-1868), samurai were considered part of the ruling class, but their actual living conditions varied greatly. Some samurai families were wealthy and powerful, while others lived modestly. The samurai class as a whole was characterized by their right to bear arms and their duty to serve the shogunate or a feudal lord, but they were not necessarily wealthy. In the case of Teisai, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly affluent. His father was a low-ranking samurai who served the shogunate, and his mother came from a family of merchants. This suggests that Teisai's family was not part of the elite, but they were also not subsistence-level laborers or peasants. They were likely somewhere in the middle, with enough resources to provide Teisai with a basic education and a decent standard of living, but not the luxuries of the upper class.","""Ubukata Teisai: His Life and Times"" by Katsuhiro Sato (2001); ""The World of the Samurai: The Lives and Lifestyles of Japan's Warrior Elite"" by Stephen Turnbull (2010)."
