0,Q5599,Peter Paul Rubens,Q5599,1577,Belgium,Middle Class,"Peter Paul Rubens was born in Siegen, Westphalia, now in modern-day Germany, to Jan Rubens and Maria Pypelincks. His father, Jan Rubens, was a lawyer and Antwerp city councilor. However, at the time of Peter Paul Rubens' birth, his father was under house arrest for having an illicit affair with Anna of Saxony, the wife of William I of Orange. His mother, Maria Pypelincks, was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Antwerp. Despite the scandal surrounding his father, Rubens' family was still considered part of the middle class due to their occupations and social standing.

The family returned to Antwerp after Jan Rubens' death in 1587, where Peter Paul Rubens received a classical education. His access to education was likely due to his family's middle-class status and not because of his personal merit. The family's living conditions would have been comfortable but not luxurious, typical of the middle class during this period.","- Belkin, Kristin Lohse. Rubens. Phaidon Press, 1998.

1,Q5598,Rembrandt,Q5598,1606,Netherlands,Middle Class,"Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was born in Leiden, Netherlands in 1606. His father, Harmen Gerritszoon van Rijn, was a miller, and his mother, Neeltgen Willemsdochter van Zuytbrouck, was a baker's daughter. This places his family within the middle class according to the given typology, as they were skilled craftspeople. 

Rembrandt was the ninth of ten children, suggesting a family of moderate means. His parents were able to afford to send him to Latin school and later to Leiden University, indicating a certain level of financial stability and access to education. 

His family lived in a house near the mill where his father worked, which suggests comfortable, if not luxurious, living conditions. There is no evidence of any inherited privileges or disadvantages.","- Schwartz, Gary. ""Rembrandt: His Life, His Paintings"". Viking Adult, 1986.

2,Q35802,Benedictus de Spinoza,Q35802,1632,Netherlands,Middle Class,"Benedictus de Spinoza was born into a Portuguese-Jewish family in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father, Michael de Spinoza, was a successful merchant and a respected member of the Portuguese-Jewish community in Amsterdam. The family was involved in the import and export of dried fruit and nuts, which was a profitable business at the time. This would suggest that the family was of the middle class, as they were not nobility but had a stable income and were not living in poverty. 

Spinoza's access to education was also indicative of his middle-class status. He received a traditional Jewish education, studying Hebrew, the Talmud, and the Torah. This education was not available to everyone and suggests that his family had the means to provide him with a good education.

Spinoza's early life housing and living conditions also point to a middle-class upbringing. His family lived in a comfortable home in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam. While they were not living in luxury, they were certainly not living in poverty either.

In terms of inherited privileges or disadvantages, it's important to note that Spinoza was born into a community of Portuguese-Jewish immigrants. While this community was relatively prosperous and well-integrated into Dutch society, they were still subject to certain restrictions and prejudices. However, this did not significantly impact Spinoza's social standing or opportunities in his early life.","1. Nadler, Steven. ""Spinoza"
3,Q12735,John Amos Comenius,Q12735,1592,Netherlands,Middle Class,"John Amos Comenius was born in Moravia, which is now a part of the Czech Republic, not the Netherlands. His parents were members of the Moravian Brethren, a pre-Reformation Christian group that valued education. His father was a miller, which was a skilled trade, and his mother came from a family of weavers. Both occupations would place them in the middle class according to the typology provided. The family was not wealthy, but they were not poor either. They had enough resources to provide Comenius with a basic education, which was furthered when he was sent to live with his aunt in Uherský Brod after the death of his parents. His aunt's husband was a priest, which would have given Comenius access to a higher level of education than he might have otherwise received. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical for a middle-class family of the time, with a comfortable home and enough food to eat.

His birth name was Thomas Hemerken, and ""à Kempis"" is a Latinized version of his hometown's name. His father, John Hemerken, was a blacksmith, and his mother, Gertrude Hemerken, was a schoolmistress. This suggests that his family was not of the elite class, but rather of the middle class, as both of his parents had skilled occupations. Thomas and his brother, John, were sent to the Brothers of the Common Life in Deventer, Netherlands, for their education. This indicates that his family had enough resources to provide him with an education, which was not a common opportunity for the subsistence class during this period. However, the fact that he was sent away for education may also suggest that his family was not wealthy enough to afford private tutors, a common practice among the elite class.

His mother's name was Margaret van Eyck. Jan had two brothers, Hubert and Lambert, both of whom were also painters, suggesting that the family had some resources and access to education, as painting was a skilled craft that required training.

His parents were Franchois Fransz Hals van Mechelen, a cloth merchant, and Adriaentje van Geertenryck. The family moved to Haarlem in the Dutch Republic (now the Netherlands) around 1591, likely due to religious persecution as they were Protestants. The occupation of Hals' father as a cloth merchant suggests that the family belonged to the middle class, as merchants were typically considered part of this social stratum during this period. However, the family's forced migration suggests they may have faced some financial instability. There's no specific information about Hals' early education, but his later work as a painter suggests he likely had some access to training or apprenticeship opportunities, which would also be consistent with a middle-class background.","""Frans Hals"", Encyclopædia Britannica, ""Frans Hals: Style and Technique"", National Gallery, London."

The family lived in a house in the center of Delft, indicating a certain level of wealth and stability. Vermeer's father's involvement in the art trade could have given Vermeer access to education in this field, although specific details about his early education are not well-documented.

Josquin's parents were likely of the middle class. His father, Gossart Desprez, was a notary, a profession that required literacy and some level of education, suggesting a middle-class status. His mother, Cécile Sauvage, was also likely from a middle-class background, though less is known about her family. 

Josquin likely had access to education due to his family's status. He may have been a choirboy at the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, which would have provided him with a musical education. However, this is speculative and not definitively proven.

The family's living conditions and wealth at the time of Josquin's birth and childhood are not well-documented, but given his father's profession, it is reasonable to assume that they were comfortable, if not wealthy.

His father, James Foe, was a fairly prosperous tallow chandler (a maker of candles and soap). This places the family in the middle class, as they were not part of the nobility or gentry, but were also not laborers or peasants. The family was able to afford a good education for Daniel, who attended the Newington Green Unitarian Church, known for its academy. This education was not a result of merit, but rather a reflection of the family's financial ability to provide for it.

Turner was sent to live with his uncle in Brentford in 1785, where he attended school.

Despite the size of the family, they were able to live comfortably in the rectory, indicating a certain level of wealth and stability. 

Tennyson's access to education was also indicative of his middle-class status. His father, having a good education himself, tutored him until he went to school in Louth. Later, he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, which would have been a privilege accessible mainly to the middle and upper classes.

However, it's worth noting that the family's financial situation became strained after the death of his father in 1831, which led to a decline in their living conditions.

His father's occupation as a schoolmaster and vicar places the family in the middle class, as these were respected positions within the community that required education and provided a stable income. However, they were not part of the wealthy elite or nobility. The family's wealth at the time of Samuel's birth and childhood was modest, and they lived in a parsonage, which was a comfortable but not luxurious home. Samuel's access to education was due to his family background, as his father was a schoolmaster and he was able to attend his father's school. After his father's death, he was sent to Christ's Hospital, a charity school in London, due to the influence of his father's former student, Judge Buller.

The family was not wealthy, but they were not poor either. They owned property and had enough income to provide a comfortable life. Locke's father's position as a lawyer and clerk provided the family with a certain level of social standing in their community. 

Locke's access to education was largely due to his father's connections. He was able to attend the prestigious Westminster School in London as a result of a recommendation from the family's local MP, Alexander Popham, a key ally of his father during the Civil War.

136,Q151403,Thomas Carlyle,Q151403,1795,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Thomas Carlyle was born in Ecclefechan, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, on December 4, 1795. His father, James Carlyle, was a stonemason and small farmer, and his mother, Margaret Aitken Carlyle, was a homemaker. This suggests that the family was not of the elite or subsistence classes, but rather of the middle class, as James Carlyle's occupation as a skilled craftsman would have likely provided a modest but stable income for the family. Thomas Carlyle was the second of nine children, indicating that the family was large but not necessarily impoverished. 

In terms of education, Carlyle was initially taught by his mother before attending the village school. He later attended Annan Academy and the University of Edinburgh, suggesting that his family had the means to support his education. 

The family lived in a small but comfortable home in Ecclefechan, which was built by Carlyle's father. This further supports the classification of Carlyle's family as middle class, as they owned their home and had the resources to maintain it. 

There is no evidence to suggest that Carlyle was born into a family with significant inherited privileges or disadvantages.

138,Q213355,John Dryden,Q213355,1631,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"John Dryden was born into a family of modest means. His father, Erasmus Dryden, was a landowner and a Justice of the Peace, which suggests a middle-class status. The Drydens were not nobility, but they were not peasants either. They were part of the gentry, a social class that owned land but did not have a noble title. This class was often involved in local governance and administration, as Erasmus Dryden was.

John Dryden's access to education also suggests a middle-class background. He attended Westminster School, a prestigious institution, but this was likely due to a scholarship rather than family wealth. His family's financial situation was not so secure that they could afford to send him to university without financial assistance, but they were well-connected enough to secure a scholarship for him.

In terms of housing and living conditions, Dryden was born in the village of Aldwincle in Northamptonshire, England. His family lived in a house known as Titchmarsh Manor, which suggests a comfortable, if not luxurious, lifestyle.

Inherited privileges or disadvantages are harder to determine. As a member of the gentry, Dryden would have had certain privileges, such as access to education and a certain level of respect in society.

This position provided the Wordsworth family with a comfortable income, but they were not part of the aristocracy. 

Wordsworth's mother, Ann Cookson, was the daughter of a merchant, further indicating a middle-class background. The family lived in a large mansion in Cockermouth, suggesting they were well-off but not part of the elite class.

Wordsworth's access to education was also indicative of his middle-class status. He attended the prestigious Hawkshead Grammar School, which was possible due to his family's resources and connections. However, his education was interrupted by his mother's death when he was eight and his father's death when he was thirteen, after which he and his siblings were sent to live with various relatives.

Inherited privileges included a good education and a comfortable upbringing, but the family was not part of the ruling class or nobility.

After the death of his father in 1664, Purcell was placed under the care of his uncle Thomas, who was also a musician at the Chapel Royal. This suggests that the family had enough resources to ensure Purcell's continued upbringing and education in music, even after the loss of his father. 

Purcell's early life housing and living conditions would have been decent, considering his father's position. He would have grown up in an environment that valued and nurtured musical talent.

175,Q185832,Emmanuel Swedenborg,Q185832,1688,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Emmanuel Swedenborg was born on January 29, 1688, in Stockholm, Sweden, not the United Kingdom. His father, Jesper Swedberg, was a Lutheran clergyman and later a bishop, which would place the family in the middle class according to the provided typology. Jesper was also a prolific writer, contributing to the religious and philosophical literature of the time. His mother, Sara Behm, came from a wealthy mining family, which could have contributed to their family wealth. However, it's important to note that the wealth of Sara's family would not necessarily have been directly accessible to Emmanuel, as it would have been controlled by her male relatives.

Swedenborg had access to education due to his family background. His father's position in the church and his mother's family wealth likely provided him with educational opportunities that may not have been available to those of lower social classes. He studied at Uppsala University, a privilege typically reserved for the middle and upper classes.

The family's housing and living conditions would likely have been comfortable but not opulent, reflecting their middle-class status. As the son of a bishop, Swedenborg would have had certain social privileges, but these would not have been on the level of the nobility or ruling class.","1. ""Swedenborg, Emanuel.""

He was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, both of whom belonged to the ruling class. His mother was the reigning queen of Scotland at the time of his birth, and his father was a nobleman. This placed James in the elite class from birth, as he was born into royalty and nobility.

However, the family's fortunes took a turn for the worse when Hollar's father died while he was still a child.

His father, James Faraday, was a blacksmith who had migrated from the north of England earlier in the 1790s. His mother, Margaret Hastwell, was a country woman of great calm and wisdom who supported her husband in his difficult times. The family was not well-off, and Faraday was the third of four children. His father was often ill and could not work regularly. As a result, the family lived in poverty.

Faraday received only a basic education in a Sunday School at his local church, as his family could not afford a better education. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local bookbinder and bookseller, George Riebau, which provided him with an opportunity to educate himself by reading books on a wide range of scientific subjects.

The family lived in a cramped and unhealthy dwelling, which was typical for families of their social standing at that time.

Matthew Arnold had access to education because of his family background. His father's position as a headmaster allowed him to attend Rugby School, and later Balliol College, Oxford. This access to education was not due to Arnold's merit, but rather his father's occupation.

The Arnold family lived in the schoolhouse at Rugby, which would have been a comfortable living situation for the time.
