0,0,Q141037,Edward Burnett Tylor,Q141037,1832,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Edward Burnett Tylor was born on October 2, 1832, in Camberwell, London, England. His parents were Joseph Tylor and Harriet Skipper, part of the Quaker community. His father, Joseph Tylor, was a brass founder and a successful businessman, which indicates a middle-class background. The Tylor family was well-off, but not part of the aristocracy or ruling class. Edward had access to education due to his family's financial stability. He attended a Quaker school in Grove House, Tottenham, but had to leave at the age of 16 due to health issues. His family's wealth and status would have provided him with a comfortable early life and living conditions. However, as Quakers, they would have been somewhat separate from the mainstream society of the time, which may have limited certain privileges.","1. Stocking, George W. ""Edward Burnett Tylor.""

1,1,Q528802,Henry More,Q528802,1614,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Henry More was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, in 1614 to Alexander More, a respected local gentleman, and his wife, Anne. His father was a successful businessman who had made a comfortable living, which allowed the family to live in a large house and employ several servants. This suggests that the More family was part of the middle class, as they were not nobility but had more wealth and status than the average laborer or peasant. Henry More was also able to receive a good education due to his family's wealth and status. He was educated at Eton College and then at Christ's College, Cambridge, which were both prestigious institutions that would have been inaccessible to those of lower social classes. However, it should be noted that More's family was not part of the elite ruling class or nobility, as they did not hold any titles or significant political power.","1.

2,2,Q741900,Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti,Q741900,1719,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti was born in Turin, Italy, not the United Kingdom, around 1719. His father was a lawyer, which would have placed the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the time. The profession of law required a certain level of education and was a respected occupation, indicative of a middle-class status. Baretti himself was educated, suggesting that his family had the means to provide him with schooling, another sign of middle-class status. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his family was particularly wealthy or that they belonged to the aristocracy.","""Baretti, Giuseppe Marc'Antonio.""
