His father was a churchman, which suggests that the family was not of the elite class but had a respectable standing in society. The profession of a churchman would have provided a stable income, placing the family in the middle class. Clarke's access to education, as evidenced by his admission to the choir school of the Chapel Royal, was likely due to his father's connections within the church, rather than the family's wealth. The family's living conditions and housing are not well-documented, but given the father's occupation, they likely lived in modest but comfortable circumstances.

His father, also named William Mason, was a clergyman of the Church of England, serving as the vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Hull. This places the Mason family in the middle class, as clergy were typically considered part of this social stratum during the 18th century. The family's wealth would have been modest but stable, and their social standing respectable. As the son of a clergyman, Mason would have had access to education, likely receiving a classical education in Latin and Greek, as was typical for the sons of the middle class during this period. The family's living conditions would have been comfortable but not luxurious, reflecting their middle-class status.

The vicarage would have provided the family with housing, and while they would not have been wealthy, they would have been comfortable. Robert Lowth's access to education was likely due to his father's position and the importance placed on education within the clergy.

His mother, Winifred Brydges, was also from a noble family. The Sackville family was one of the most prominent and wealthy families in England at the time, owning large estates in Sussex and Kent. Thomas Sackville was therefore born into considerable wealth and privilege. He had access to education due to his family background, attending both the University of Oxford and Cambridge, which was a privilege reserved for the elite during this period.

His father, Sir William Frederick Pollock, 2nd Baronet, was a British lawyer and Tory politician, serving as Queen's Counsel and Attorney General to Prince Albert. This suggests that the family was part of the ruling class, with significant influence and wealth. The title of Baronet itself is a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown, further indicating their elite status. The Pollock family would have had access to the best education, housing, and living conditions available at the time due to their family background and wealth.

His father, Samuel Reynolds, was a successful schoolmaster, which suggests a middle-class background. The occupation of a schoolmaster during the late 18th century in England was considered a respectable profession, often associated with the middle class. It is reasonable to assume that Reynolds' family had some degree of financial stability, given his father's profession. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they were part of the elite or subsistence classes.

She was the eighth of nine children born to John Simpson, a farmer, and his wife Mary. Her father's occupation as a farmer indicates that the family was not of the elite class, but rather of the middle class, as they were not laborers or peasants, but owned and operated their own farm. However, they were not wealthy, as indicated by the fact that Elizabeth received only a minimal education. After her mother's death, Elizabeth was sent to a boarding school in Bury St Edmunds, but she had to leave after only two years due to lack of funds. This suggests that while the family had enough resources to initially send her to school, they were not affluent.

The Sidney family was wealthy and owned several estates, including Penshurst Place in Kent, where Mary was likely born and raised. As a member of the nobility, Mary would have had access to a high level of education, and it is known that she was tutored by her mother's brother, Robert Dudley, who was a scholar and a patron of the arts.

The fact that Thomas Richmond was able to provide his son with an education in art from a young age further supports this classification. George Richmond was apprenticed to the engraver Charles Heath at the age of 14, indicating that his family had the means to secure such an opportunity for him. There is no evidence to suggest that the Richmond family was particularly wealthy or that they were part of the aristocracy, nor is there evidence to suggest that they were living in poverty.

Georgiana was born into immense wealth and privilege, and she was raised in the grand Spencer family home, Althorp, in Northamptonshire.

There is no evidence to suggest that the Alkens were part of the elite ruling class or nobility, nor were they subsistence laborers or peasants. The fact that Henry Thomas Alken followed in his father's footsteps and became an artist himself suggests that he had access to some form of education or training, which was more common among middle-class families during this period.

His father, Thomas Gosse, was a miniature painter, and his mother, Hannah Best, was the daughter of a farmer. This suggests that the family was not part of the elite or subsistence classes, but rather the middle class. Thomas Gosse's profession as a miniature painter would have required a certain level of skill and training, which is characteristic of middle-class occupations during this period. Furthermore, the fact that Hannah Best was the daughter of a farmer suggests that the family had some level of land ownership, another characteristic of the middle class. However, the family was not wealthy, and after the death of his mother when he was only six, Gosse was sent to live with an aunt in Poole, Dorset. This suggests that the family may have been on the lower end of the middle class spectrum. Gosse's education was largely self-directed, as he had a keen interest in natural history from a young age.

Thomas Tomkins' early access to education is evidenced by his appointment as an organist at Worcester Cathedral in 1596, suggesting he had received musical training during his childhood. This opportunity for education, likely facilitated by his father's position, suggests a middle-class upbringing. There is no evidence to suggest that Tomkins was born into either the elite or subsistence classes. His early life housing and living conditions would have been modest but comfortable, typical of a middle-class family in the late 16th century.","""Thomas Tomkins: The Last Elizabethan"" by Anthony Boden, ""The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"" by H.
