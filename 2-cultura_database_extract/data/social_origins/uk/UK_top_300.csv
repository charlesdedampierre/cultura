0,Q692,William Shakespeare,Q692,1564,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, in 1564. His father, John Shakespeare, was a glove maker and wool merchant, and his mother, Mary Arden, was the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. This suggests that the family was of the middle class, as they were involved in skilled crafts and trade, and owned land. John Shakespeare also held several positions in local government, including high bailiff (similar to a mayor), indicating a certain level of social standing within their community. 

William Shakespeare likely attended the King's New School in Stratford, a grammar school that provided free education to all boys in the area, suggesting that his family's social standing and local residence provided him with access to education. 

The family lived in a house on Henley Street, which was a substantial dwelling with multiple rooms, indicating a level of wealth and comfort above subsistence living. However, the family's fortunes declined during Shakespeare's teenage years due to his father's financial difficulties, but this does not change their social class at the time of his birth and early childhood.","- Ackroyd, Peter.

1,Q5686,Charles Dickens,Q5686,1812,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England, to John and Elizabeth Dickens. His father, John Dickens, worked as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, a position that would have placed the family in the middle class. However, John Dickens was notoriously bad with money, and the family was often in financial trouble. This led to a period of time when Charles was a child during which the family was sent to Marshalsea debtor's prison, and Charles was sent to work in a factory. Despite these hardships, Charles was able to attend school for a time due to his family's middle-class status, before his father's debts forced him out.","- ""Charles Dickens.""

3,Q38082,Lewis Carroll,Q38082,1832,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Lewis Carroll, whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, was born on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England. His parents were Charles Dodgson and Frances Jane Lutwidge. His father was a clergyman, a profession that was considered part of the middle class during the Victorian era in the United Kingdom. The Dodgson family was large, with Charles being the eldest of 11 children, which suggests that while they may not have been wealthy, they were not living in poverty either. 

In terms of education, Charles had access to a good education due to his father's profession. He was initially educated at home, and later attended Richmond School in Yorkshire, and then Rugby School. His father's profession and the family's religious background likely played a significant role in his access to education.

As for housing and living conditions, the Dodgson family lived in a parsonage, which would have been a comfortable, if not luxurious, dwelling. This further supports the classification of the Dodgson family as middle class.

Inherited privileges or disadvantages would have been minimal. As the son of a clergyman, Charles would have had certain social advantages, such as access to education and a certain level of respectability, but he would not have had the wealth or political power associated with the elite class.","- Cohen, Morton N.

His father, Heinrich Marx, was a lawyer and a man of the Enlightenment, interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. Heinrich Marx was also a successful and respected lawyer, which provided a comfortable middle-class lifestyle for the Marx family. His mother, Henrietta Pressburg, came from a wealthy Dutch family involved in commerce. 

Marx's family was Jewish, but his father converted to Protestantism in 1816 due to anti-Jewish laws enforced by the Prussian state. This conversion allowed him to continue his law practice and maintain his social standing. 

Marx received a high-quality education. He was home-schooled until the age of 12 and then attended the Trier Gymnasium. His early education, along with his family's financial stability, suggests a middle-class upbringing.","1. ""Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life"" by Jonathan Sperber.

His father, Thomas Stevenson, was a prosperous civil engineer, and his mother, Margaret Isabella Balfour, came from a family of lawyers and church ministers. The Stevenson family was well-established in the field of lighthouse design and construction, which was a respected and well-paid profession during the 19th century. This would place them firmly within the middle class, as they were skilled professionals but not part of the aristocracy or ruling class.

Stevenson's family wealth allowed him access to education. He was initially educated at home by private tutors due to his poor health, and later attended Edinburgh Academy and the University of Edinburgh. His family's wealth and social standing would have made this level of education possible.

The family lived in a comfortable home in Heriot Row, a prestigious address in Edinburgh's New Town. This suggests that they were able to afford a high standard of living, further supporting their classification as middle class.

Stevenson did not inherit a title or any other form of aristocratic privilege, but he did inherit a comfortable lifestyle and access to education, which were significant advantages in the context of 19th-century Scotland.","1.

7,Q41513,William Blake,Q41513,1757,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"William Blake was born on November 28, 1757, in London, England, to James Blake, a hosier, and Catherine Wright Armitage Blake. His father's occupation as a hosier, a dealer in stockings, gloves, and haberdashery, places the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the late 18th century United Kingdom. The family was not wealthy, but they were not impoverished either. They were able to afford a modest house in Broad Street, in the district of Golden Square of Soho, a respectable if not fashionable part of London. 

Blake was the third of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. The Blakes were English Dissenters, a Christian movement that developed in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and were known for their independence of thought. This religious background may have influenced the family's decision to educate William at home, rather than sending him to a conventional school. Blake's mother taught him to read and write, and his father encouraged his artistic talents by buying him casts to draw and sending him to drawing school. 

While Blake did not have access to a formal education, his family's resources and support allowed him to develop his artistic and literary skills from a young age. This suggests a level of financial stability and cultural capital that was typical of the middle class during this period.","""Blake, William."" Encyclopædia"

She and her sisters were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, which was a school for the daughters of impoverished clergyman. However, the conditions at the school were harsh and Charlotte's two older sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, died from tuberculosis contracted at the school. This tragedy led Patrick Brontë to withdraw Charlotte and her younger sister Emily from the school.

This profession would have provided a stable income for the family. Handel's mother, Dorothea, was the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, suggesting a family background with some level of education and social standing.

26,Q171344,William Hogarth,Q171344,1697,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"William Hogarth was born in London around 1697. His father, Richard Hogarth, was a Latin teacher and textbook writer, which suggests a middle-class background. However, the family's financial situation was unstable. Richard Hogarth was an unsuccessful businessman who spent time in debtor's prison, which would have significantly affected the family's living conditions and wealth during William's childhood. Despite these hardships, William was able to access education, likely due to his father's profession. He was apprenticed to a silver plate engraver, a skilled trade, in his early teens. This suggests that the family, despite their financial struggles, still had the resources and connections to secure such an apprenticeship. Overall, the evidence suggests a middle-class origin, albeit one marked by financial instability and hardship.","- ""Hogarth, William (1697–1764), painter and engraver"" by Ronald Paulson, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Burns' father attempted to improve their circumstances by building a house and trying to acquire a better farm, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful, and the family lived in poverty.

Despite their financial struggles, Burns' parents valued education and made efforts to ensure their children received some form of schooling. Burns' father taught his children reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and history. Later, Burns was sent to a school in Dalrymple Parish, and then to a school in Kirkoswald, where he studied grammar, French, and Latin.

However, the family's fortunes declined due to the financial crisis of 1816 and the bank's subsequent failure, causing Newman to withdraw from school and be tutored at home.

His father, Robert Darwin, was a lawyer by profession, and his mother, Elizabeth Hill, came from a family of gentry. The Darwins were a well-respected family in their community, but they were not part of the aristocracy or ruling class.

Erasmus Darwin's access to education was a direct result of his family's social standing. His father's profession and connections enabled him to attend the Chesterfield School, a reputable grammar school, and later to study at St John's College, Cambridge. 

The Darwin family lived in Elston Hall, a substantial family home, indicating a comfortable living condition. However, they did not possess the vast estates or grand palaces associated with the elite class.

He studied at the University of Glasgow, which would have been beyond the reach of subsistence-level families. However, it's important to note that his education was not necessarily a result of family wealth, but possibly due to the support of relatives or the Church.

213,Q278699,William Petty,Q278699,1623,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"William Petty was born in the town of Romsey, England, in 1623. His father, Anthony Petty, was a clothier by trade, which indicates a middle-class background. Clothiers were involved in the production and trade of cloth, a significant industry in England during the 17th century. This occupation would have provided a comfortable, though not luxurious, living for the Petty family. There is no evidence to suggest that the Petty family had any noble or aristocratic connections, nor were they impoverished. 

In terms of education, Petty was able to attend a free grammar school in Romsey, which suggests that his family had some level of social standing in the community. However, it was not his family's wealth or status that allowed him to attend university. Instead, he was able to attend through a fellowship, which was based on merit rather than family background.

His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical of a middle-class family in 17th century England. They would have lived in a modest home, likely in the town of Romsey. 

In terms of inherited privileges or disadvantages, it appears that Petty was born into a relatively stable and secure middle-class family. His father's occupation as a clothier would have provided a steady income, and his access to education suggests that his family was respected in the community. However, he did not inherit any significant wealth or titles, nor was he born into poverty or disadvantage.

Barry's father was a grocer and the family was considered to be of the middle class. The Bulkley family was well-connected, with ties to several influential figures, including James Barry, a successful painter and professor at the Royal Academy in London, after whom Margaret Bulkley later took her name. However, the family's fortunes declined after the father's death, leading to financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, Barry was able to receive an education, largely due to the influence of her uncle, James Barry, who was a member of the Royal Academy of Arts. This suggests a middle-class upbringing, with access to education and connections to influential figures, despite financial instability.","Du Preez, H. (2006).
