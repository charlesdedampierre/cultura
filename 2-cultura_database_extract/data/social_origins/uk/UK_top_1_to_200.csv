0,Q141037,Edward Burnett Tylor,Q141037,1832,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Edward Burnett Tylor was born on October 2, 1832, in Camberwell, London, England. His father, Joseph Tylor, was a brass founder and a successful businessman. The Tylor family was part of the Quaker community, which was known for its emphasis on education and self-improvement. This suggests that Tylor had access to education due to his family background. His father's occupation as a brass founder indicates that the family was likely part of the middle class, as they were not nobility but had a stable income from a skilled trade. There is no evidence to suggest that Tylor was born into poverty or extreme wealth, so the middle class is the most likely classification.","""Edward Burnett Tylor, Religion and Culture"" by Paul-François Tremlett, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017; ""Edward B.

1,Q528802,Henry More,Q528802,1614,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Henry More was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire in England around 1614. His father, Alexander More, was a respected local gentleman and a successful businessman who had made a fortune in the cloth trade. This suggests that the More family were comfortably middle class, with a stable income and a good reputation in their community. Henry's mother, Anne More, was also from a respectable family. 

The More family's wealth and social standing allowed Henry to receive a good education. He was sent to Eton College, a prestigious school for boys, and later attended Christ's College, Cambridge. This level of education was typically only accessible to the middle and upper classes during this period.

In terms of housing and living conditions, it can be inferred that the More family lived comfortably. The fact that Alexander More was able to amass a significant fortune in the cloth trade suggests that the family would have been able to afford a decent home and a comfortable lifestyle.

As for inherited privileges or disadvantages, it seems that Henry More was born into a relatively privileged situation. His family's wealth and social standing would have afforded him opportunities that were not available to those from lower social classes.","- ""Henry More (1614–1687)"" by Sarah Hutton, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2006.

As such, Paxton's family would have been considered part of the subsistence class, as they were laborers with minimal resources. Paxton's early life was marked by hard work on the family farm, and he did not have access to formal education due to his family's socioeconomic status.

His father, Samuel Cosway, was a schoolmaster, which suggests a middle-class background, as education was a profession typically associated with this social stratum during the 18th century. His mother, Mary Cosway, was reported to be a talented musician, which further suggests a middle-class upbringing, as the ability to pursue music often required some level of financial stability and access to education. There is no evidence to suggest that the Cosway family was particularly wealthy or part of the elite class, nor that they were struggling for subsistence. Richard and his brother William were both sent to London to study at the Duke of Richmond's academy, indicating that the family had the means to invest in their children's education.

His father, John Lee Lewes, was an actor and minor poet, which suggests a middle-class background. His mother, Elizabeth Ashweek, was from a family of Huguenot refugees. Lewes was educated at a variety of schools, including Dr Charles Burney's in Greenwich, which suggests that his family had the means to provide him with a decent education. However, his father's death when Lewes was just a child and subsequent financial difficulties faced by his mother suggest that the family was not wealthy. Lewes was sent to live with a Quaker family in London after his father's death, which suggests that his mother struggled to provide for him.","- ""George Henry Lewes.""

There is no evidence to suggest that the family had significant wealth or land beyond what would be expected for their class. Earlom's access to education is not well-documented, but his early apprenticeship with record painter Jeremiah Meyer suggests that he had some access to training in the arts, which would have been more likely for a middle-class child than for a child from a subsistence-level family.

His father, Wilhelm Cramer, was a renowned violinist who served as the leader of the King's band in England. This suggests that the family had a certain level of social standing and financial stability, as Wilhelm's position would have been a respected and reasonably well-paid one. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was part of the elite or aristocracy. The family's access to music education, which Johann received from an early age, further supports their middle-class status.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Vossius family was part of the elite ruling class or nobility.

Unfortunately, Abraham's father died before he was born, leaving the family in a more precarious financial situation.

152,Q2661131,James Stuart,Q2661131,1713,United Kingdom,Elite,"James Stuart, born in 1713, was a member of the British royal family, being the son of James Francis Edward Stuart and Maria Clementina Sobieska. His father, James Francis Edward Stuart, was the son of King James II and VII of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and claimed the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones as the rightful king after the deposition of his father. His mother, Maria Clementina Sobieska, was the granddaughter of the Polish king, John III Sobieski. Therefore, James Stuart was born into the elite class of society, with his parents being of royal descent and claiming thrones. His family wealth at the time of his birth and childhood was significant, as they were supported by various European courts who recognized their claims. His access to education was also privileged due to his family background, as he would have been tutored by private tutors, a luxury only the elite could afford. His early life housing and living conditions would have been of high standard, as befitting his royal status.","1. Corp, Edward (2009).

His father, Samuel Northcote, was a watchmaker, which was a skilled trade during that period. This suggests that the family was not of the elite class, but neither were they subsistence laborers. The watchmaking profession would have provided a stable income for the family, placing them in the middle class. Northcote's access to education also suggests a middle-class background. He was apprenticed to his father's watchmaking business, which indicates that he received some form of vocational education. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he received a formal education, which would have been more typical of the elite class.

However, Richard Westall's father died when he was still young, leaving the family in a precarious financial situation.
