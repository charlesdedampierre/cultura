191,Q632772,Francis Cotes,Q632772,1726,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Francis Cotes was born in London, England around 1726 to a family of apothecaries. His father, Robert Cotes, was a respected member of the Society of Apothecaries, a professional organization for medical practitioners. This suggests that the family had a comfortable income and a stable social standing within the middle class. The profession of apothecary required a certain level of education and skill, which further supports this classification. Francis Cotes was able to receive an education, as evidenced by his later career as a portrait painter, which would have required training and education that was typically accessible to the middle class during this period. The family's ability to support Cotes' education and training suggests they had some degree of wealth and resources. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Cotes family had significant inherited wealth, land, or titles that would classify them as elite. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that they lived in subsistence conditions.","""Francis Cotes: 1726-1770"" by Neil Jeffares; ""The Society of Apothecaries and the Medical Profession in London, 1700-1800"" by Elizabeth Lane Furdell."
192,Q718709,William Crotch,Q718709,1775,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"William Crotch was born in Norwich, England in 1775. His father, Thomas Crotch, was a master carpenter, a profession that would place the family in the middle class according to the social structure of the late 18th century United Kingdom. The family was not of noble birth or extreme wealth, but they were not impoverished either. William's parents were able to afford a small organ for him to play at a young age, indicating some level of disposable income. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they had significant wealth or land. As for education, it is known that William showed an early aptitude for music and was given the opportunity to develop his skills, but this seems to have been more a result of his exceptional talent than of his family's ability to provide him with a formal education. His early life housing and living conditions would have been typical for a middle-class family of the time.","""The Life of William Crotch (1775-1847)"" by Richard Charlton; ""The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"" by H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison."

196,Q218322,Joseph Butler,Q218322,1692,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Joseph Butler was born in Wantage in the county of Berkshire, England. His father was a prosperous draper, which indicates a middle-class standing as drapers were skilled merchants dealing in cloth and textiles. His family was of the Presbyterian faith, which was a significant religious group during that time, suggesting a certain level of social standing. Butler's access to education was also indicative of his middle-class background. His father intended for him to go into the Presbyterian ministry and sent him to a dissenting academy at Gloucester, followed by a training at a seminary in Tewkesbury. This level of education was not typically accessible to those of lower social classes in the late 17th century. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Butler's family was part of the elite or ruling class, nor that they possessed significant wealth beyond their business.","""Joseph Butler"", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; ""Joseph Butler"", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy."
