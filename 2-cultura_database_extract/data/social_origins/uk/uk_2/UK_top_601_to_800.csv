The middle class in the late 17th century England consisted of merchants, artisans, skilled craftspeople, landowners, and teachers. Senex later became a renowned geographer and engraver, which suggests that he likely had access to some form of education and training in his early years, a privilege often associated with the middle class.

This position would have placed the D'Oyly family among the ruling class in India during the late 1700s, as the British East India Company held significant political and economic power in the region at that time. The D'Oyly family's baronetcy, a hereditary title granted by the British Crown, further indicates their elite status.

His father, William Muir Sr., was a merchant, which was a typical occupation of the middle class during this period. The Muir family was not part of the aristocracy, but they were also not subsistence-level laborers or peasants. They were part of the burgeoning middle class that was growing in size and influence during the 19th century due to the Industrial Revolution. Muir's access to education was likely due to his family's middle-class status, as education during this period was often limited to those who could afford it. There is no evidence to suggest that Muir lived in poverty or that he had any inherited privileges or disadvantages due to his birth.","""William Muir: An Intellectual Biography"" by John S.
