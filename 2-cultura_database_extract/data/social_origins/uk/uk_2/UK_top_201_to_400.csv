0,Q347222,Frederic Harrison,Q347222,1831,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Frederic Harrison was born on October 18, 1831, in London, England. His father, Frederick Harrison, was a stockbroker, which was a profession that typically belonged to the middle class during the 19th century in England. His mother, Jane Brice, was the daughter of a prosperous merchant, which further supports the classification of Harrison's family as middle class. The family's wealth and social standing would have allowed Harrison access to education, which was not a privilege afforded to all children during this time period.

1,Q726087,Richard Bradley,Q726087,1688,United Kingdom,Middle Class,"Richard Bradley was born around 1688 in England. His father was a farmer, which places the family in the middle class according to the typology provided. Farming during this period was a respectable occupation, often associated with land ownership and a stable income, but it did not confer the status of the elite class. There is no evidence to suggest that Bradley's family was particularly wealthy or impoverished, so it is reasonable to assume they were of average means for their social class. Bradley's access to education is indicative of his middle-class status. He attended Cambridge University, which, while not exclusive to the elite, was certainly not accessible to the subsistence class. His early life housing and living conditions are not well-documented, but given his father's occupation, it is likely that he lived in a rural setting with adequate, if not luxurious, accommodations.

His father, Ramkanto Roy, was a Vaishnavite, while his mother, Tarinidevi, was from a Shivaite family. This suggests that his family had a significant social standing, as Brahmins were the highest caste in the Hindu caste system, often associated with scholarly and priestly duties. His family's wealth and status would have provided him with access to education from a young age. He was sent to Patna for higher studies, which indicates that his family had the resources to support his education.

The profession of a music teacher was considered skilled labor and was typically associated with the middle class in the late 18th century. There is no evidence to suggest that the Callcott family was part of the elite or subsistence classes. The family's ability to provide Augustus with an education, as he attended the Royal Academy Schools, further indicates a middle-class status, as education was often a privilege reserved for the middle and upper classes during this period.

This profession would have provided a comfortable living, but not the wealth associated with the elite class. It is also likely that Humphreys had access to education due to his father's profession, as literacy and education would have been valued in a family involved in the publishing industry.

The family moved to Paris in 1765 where Curtius opened a cabinet de portraits en cire (wax portrait exhibition). While her father's occupation as a soldier might suggest a lower social class, her mother's employment and their relationship with Dr. Curtius, a skilled professional, suggest a middle-class standing. The family's move to Paris and the opening of a business also indicate a level of financial stability and social mobility.
