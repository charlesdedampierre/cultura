0,Q5586,Katsushika Hokusai,Q5586,1760,Japan,Middle Class,"Katsushika Hokusai was born in Edo (now Tokyo), Japan, around 1760. His father was Nakajima Ise, a mirror-maker for the shogun, which was a respectable occupation in the Edo period. This suggests that Hokusai was born into a middle-class family. However, his mother's background is not well documented. Hokusai was adopted by an uncle at a young age, who was an artist. This suggests that he had access to some form of education in the arts from an early age, which was a privilege usually reserved for the middle and upper classes. His early life housing and living conditions are not well documented, but given his father's occupation and his adoption by an artist, it can be inferred that his living conditions were likely modest but comfortable.","""Hokusai: Beyond the Great Wave"" by Timothy Clark, published by the British Museum; ""Hokusai"" by Gian Carlo Calza, published by Phaidon Press."

His father, Andō Gen'emon, was a member of the fire-fighting organization responsible for protecting Edo Castle, the residence of the shogun. This position was hereditary and considered a samurai rank, but it was not part of the ruling elite. It was a respectable position, but not one of great wealth or power. Hiroshige's family would have been considered middle class according to the social structure of the time. They were not wealthy aristocrats, but they were also not peasants or laborers. Hiroshige's father taught him the basics of drawing and painting, indicating that the family had some access to education and cultural pursuits. However, Hiroshige's father died when he was 12, and he took over his father's role as a fireman, suggesting that the family was not wealthy enough to live without his income.","""Hiroshige: From Edo to Kyoto—A Journey through Japan.""

2,Q5676,Matsuo Bashō,Q5676,1644,Japan,Middle Class,"Matsuo Bashō was born in Ueno, in the Iga Province of Japan. His family were likely minor samurai, which would place them in the middle class according to the social structure of Japan in the late 1600s. Samurai were considered part of the ruling class, but their actual living conditions varied greatly, and many, like Bashō's family, were not wealthy. Bashō's father was likely a low-ranking samurai, working as a kind of farmer-warrior in the rural province. 

Bashō's access to education was likely due to his samurai background, as samurai families typically provided their children with a good education. However, it's important to note that Bashō's family was not wealthy, and he did not inherit significant privileges or advantages. His early life housing and living conditions were likely modest, reflecting the family's status as minor samurai.","- Ueda, Makoto. ""Basho and His Interpreters: Selected Hokku with Commentary"".

His father, Charles Bush Hearn, was an Irish surgeon in the British army, and his mother, Rosa Antoniou Kassimati, was a native Greek woman. This suggests a middle-class background, as his father was a professional, but not part of the aristocracy or ruling class. His mother's family was also middle class, as they were landowners on the island. However, Hearn's early life was marked by instability and hardship. His parents separated when he was young, and he was sent to live with a great-aunt in Dublin, Ireland. Despite these challenges, Hearn had access to education, attending a Catholic school in France and later a boarding school in England.

This suggests that his family had some degree of wealth and social standing, as they were able to provide him with a good education.

The ferryboat business would have provided a steady income, and the fact that his father was a poet suggests a certain level of education and cultural engagement, which is more typical of the middle class.

The name James Robertson is of Scottish origin, and it is highly unusual for such a name to be associated with Japan in the early 19th century, as Japan was largely closed to foreigners during this period due to the Sakoku policy. Therefore, it is difficult to determine his social class based on the available information.","Any potential sources that could provide this information would likely be historical records from Japan during the early 19th century, or Scottish records of individuals traveling to Japan during this period.

They were part of the chōnin class, which was a social class that included merchants and artisans. This class was not wealthy like the samurai class, but they were not subsistence level either. They had a certain level of economic stability and social respect. Therefore, it can be inferred that Takeda Izumo II was born into a middle-class family.

Despite this, Bairei's family still had access to education, as samurai families traditionally valued learning. Bairei was able to study painting from a young age under the tutelage of Nakajima Raisho, a painter of the Maruyama school.

His father, Kawahara Kichibei, was a middle-class merchant, which was a respectable occupation in the late Edo period. The family was not part of the samurai class (nobility), but they were also not peasants or laborers. They were part of the chōnin (townspeople) class, which included merchants and artisans. This class was not as privileged as the samurai class, but they were generally better off than the peasant class. There is no specific information about Keiga's early life housing and living conditions, but as a merchant's son, he likely lived in a decent house in a town.

His father, Itō Tōgai, was a doctor, indicating a middle-class status as per the social structure of Japan in the late 1600s. The profession of a physician was considered a respectable occupation, often associated with the middle class. Itō's family was not part of the ruling samurai class or the peasant class, placing them in the middle of the social hierarchy. Itō's access to education was also a result of his family background. His father, being a physician, would have had a good education and likely ensured his son received one as well. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Itō's family was particularly wealthy or that they lived in luxurious conditions, which would be characteristic of the elite class.

The samurai class in Japan during this period was a hereditary caste, but it was also a bureaucratic and administrative class, and many samurai families lived modestly.
