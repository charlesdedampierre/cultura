His father was Matsudaira Sadakuni, a daimyo (feudal lord) of the Shirakawa Domain. This places Sadanobu in the elite class, as the samurai were the ruling military class of the time, and daimyo were among the most powerful figures within that class. The Matsudaira clan was particularly influential, being directly related to the Tokugawa shogunate, the ruling military government. Sadanobu's birth into this family would have granted him access to education and a high standard of living, as was customary for children of the samurai class.

His father's position as a samurai would have provided Sōgi with some access to education, as samurai families were typically literate and valued learning. However, his mother's merchant background suggests that the family's wealth was not inherited, but rather earned through trade.

This indicates that Tsunenaga was born into a family of considerable social standing and wealth.

Some were wealthy landowners, while others were more akin to middle-class bureaucrats or even lower-class soldiers.

Bunchō's family would have had some level of wealth and social standing due to their samurai status, but not to the extent of the elite class. As a samurai's son, Bunchō would have had access to education, which was highly valued in samurai families. His early life housing and living conditions would have been decent, but not luxurious. 

There is no evidence of any inherited privileges or disadvantages, beyond the general advantages and disadvantages associated with being a samurai's son in this period. For example, he would have been expected to follow in his father's footsteps and serve as a samurai, which could be seen as both a privilege and a disadvantage depending on one's perspective.","- ""Ippitsusai Bunchō: A"
